Emphasize the survey's contribution (structured analysis, highlighting gaps) and issue a strong call to action for sustained research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical vigilance for responsible development of trustworthy AI ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice', 'bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey', 'investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Ensure the \"Call to Action\" is specific and forward-looking, building directly on the future research directions outlined in Chapter 9. Encourage specific actions for researchers, developers, policymakers, and users, linking back to the importance of responsible LLM development and deployment ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].", "outline_suggestion": "1. Establish a strong theoretical foundation and compelling ethical framing from the outset, foregrounding the societal impact and consolidating core definitions. This addresses suggestions emphasizing early integration of ethical and societal dimensions and the need for a rigorous theoretical basis by creating dedicated sections for these critical areas ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms', 'ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models', 'navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms', 'investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data', 'cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice', 'confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications', 'bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n- Modify Section 1 (Introduction): Enhance the Digest Construction to explicitly require extraction of statements highlighting the critical need for addressing bias and fairness due to the increasing societal impact and widespread deployment of LLMs across various applications. The Digest Analysis should synthesize these points to establish the ethical imperative for responsible development and deployment and motivate the subsequent technical discussions, aligning with feedback to integrate societal impact early on ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms', 'fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms', 'ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n- Introduce a new major section, \"Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs,\" positioned after the introduction as Section 2. This section will consolidate and deepen the analysis of definitions and concepts previously distributed across Sections 3 and parts of 5. Create subsections: 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias, and 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness. This dedicated structure provides a logical flow for foundational theoretical concepts, addressing the need for rigorous theoretical grounding and hierarchical organization ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms', 'fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n    - For Section 2.1 (Definitions and Typologies of Bias), the Digest Construction should explicitly guide the extraction of various types of biases (social, demographic, representational, cognitive bias ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice']), their conceptual bases, and any proposed taxonomies (compositional approaches ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']). Add a \"Critique of Existing Work\" element to prompt extraction of challenges and ambiguities in definitions. The Digest Analysis should critically compare and contrast these from different papers, discussing implications and integrating critiques.\n    - For Section 2.2 (Definitions and Metrics of Fairness), the Digest Construction should require extracting different fairness definitions and quantitative metrics, including their mathematical formulations (e.g., demographic parity $$|P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1)|$$, equalized odds $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=1)$$ and $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=0) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=0)$$ ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']). Also, extract underlying ethical principles ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'] and challenges in application. Add a \"Critique of Existing Work\" element. The Digest Analysis should critically compare metrics, discussing strengths, weaknesses, trade-offs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'], and challenges, integrating critiques.\n- Modify the title of original Section 2 (now Section 3) to \"LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\" and refine its description. The Digest Construction should focus on LLM aspects relevant to bias introduction/propagation: training data scale/characteristics ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms', 'navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms', 'confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'], learning paradigm, emergent properties, and probabilistic generation. Remove general use cases and detailed mechanisms as separate sub-sections, integrating relevant parts into this chapter's focus on *how* bias enters based on LLM mechanics. The Digest Analysis should synthesize how these fundamentals contribute to or amplify bias, emphasizing inherent bias from pre-training as a core challenge ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n\n2. Systematically analyze the sources and manifestations of bias throughout the LLM lifecycle with empirical evidence, detailed mechanisms, and critical assessment.

Compare the impact of different sources and integrate empirical findings (e.g., inherent biases in pretraining data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']), incorporating extracted critiques. The main Section 4 Digest Analysis should provide a high-level overview and transition to subsections.\n\n3. Enhance rigor in evaluation and mitigation analysis by focusing on detailed methodologies, empirical outcomes, challenges, trade-offs, and critical assessment. This addresses feedback for more structured, evidence-based analysis of technical approaches ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models', 'understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms', 'confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications', 'investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data', 'how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms', 'navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n- Restructure original Section 5 (now Section 5) to \"Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks.\" Create subsections: 5.1 Benchmark Datasets, 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies, and 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation. This provides a logical breakdown.\n    - For 5.1 and 5.2 Digest Construction: Explicitly require extracting details about specific benchmarks (e.g., CEB ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']), their design, taxonomy, specific metrics used ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'], how calculated, and methodologies ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].

Section 6 Digest Analysis should provide an overview and transition.\n\n4. Integrate case studies and ethical/standardization considerations with practical relevance and governance. This addresses feedback to consolidate practical frameworks and ethical considerations and include specific examples ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models', 'navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation', 'how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms', 'investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data', 'confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n- Modify original Section 7 (now Section 7) to \"Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies.\" Retain subsections 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'] and 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. For subsections, request details on unique challenges, evaluation methods, solutions, comparative data, and ethical considerations in these specific contexts. Add a \"Critique of Existing Work\" label to extract limitations in understanding or addressing fairness in these cases. The Digest Analysis should critically analyze these challenges and comparisons based on evidence, integrating critiques. The main Section 7 Digest Analysis should introduce the concept of case studies and acknowledge the limited scope to these examples based on provided papers, highlighting the need for broader application research in the challenges section.\n- Modify original Section 8 (now Section 8) to \"Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance.\" Subdivide into: 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines, 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles, and 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance.

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n\n## 1. Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, are advanced AI systems that leverage deep learning techniques and are trained on vast text corpora to model and process human language [3,7]. These models have demonstrated remarkable success in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, translation, question answering, and summarization [1,7]. Their increasing scale and capabilities have led to widespread deployment across diverse applications, including conversational AI, content creation, code assistance, customer service, personalized marketing, and data analytics, fueling the generative AI revolution [1,3,4,6]. LLMs and NLP systems work in tandem to achieve sophisticated language understanding and knowledge acquisition from large datasets [3].\n\nHowever, the increasing integration and societal impact of LLMs necessitate a critical focus on the potential for bias and unfairness embedded within these models [1,3,4,6,8,10]. AI systems, including LLMs, can replicate and amplify human biases present in their training data, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or discrimination against individuals and social groups [4,7,8]. For instance, studies have shown that job descriptions generated by generative AI can contain significantly more stereotypes than those written by humans, including powerful models like GPT-4o [4]. This potential for harm is particularly concerning when LLMs are applied in high-stakes domains such as clinical settings or sensitive tabular prediction tasks [8,9]. The biases in LLMs can perpetuate negative stereotypes, erase marginalized worldviews, and reinforce existing inequalities [7].\n\nThe growing significance of this issue is evidenced by the increase in scientific papers addressing fairness and bias, which rose by 25% between 2022 and 2024, according to the Stanford AI Index Report [4]. Recognizing the critical need for responsible development and deployment, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of bias and fairness in LLMs [1,6]. It establishes the ethical imperative for addressing bias and fairness to ensure that LLMs benefit society equitably [1,3,6,8]. This includes exploring how standards can mitigate harmful biases and analyzing current standardization efforts [7]. By synthesizing existing research on definitions, sources, evaluation methods, and mitigation strategies [1], this survey motivates the subsequent technical discussions on identifying and addressing bias to facilitate the responsible implementation of LLM-based technologies [6].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nBuilding upon the foundational introduction and the ethical imperative for responsible development and deployment of LLMs, this section provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding bias and fairness. It addresses the need for rigorous theoretical grounding and hierarchical organization by delving into the core concepts, typologies, and definitions that underpin the study of bias and fairness in LLMs [2,3,7]. The discussion is structured around the categories of bias and different definitions of fairness, highlighting the current understanding and the challenges in achieving equitable and non-discriminatory LLMs [1].\n\nThe section first explores the definitions and typologies of bias in LLMs. Bias is broadly understood as systematic and unfair deviations or prejudices [10]. Various classifications are presented, including cognitive, statistical, methodological, and socio-historical biases, as well as more specific manifestations like social, demographic, and representational biases [6]. The diverse origins and manifestations of bias, from data-driven issues to contextual and linguistic nuances, are discussed [6]. This exploration reveals the complexity and multifaceted nature of bias in LLMs, highlighting the difficulty in establishing a universally agreed-upon taxonomy and the need for a more comprehensive understanding of their interactions and overlaps [1].\n\nSubsequently, the section focuses on the definitions and metrics of fairness. Fairness in LLMs is centered on equitable and non-discriminatory treatment, aligning with ethical principles of non-discrimination, equity, and justice [1,10]. Concepts such as group fairness and individual fairness, adapted from traditional machine learning, are introduced. Key quantitative metrics for evaluating fairness, such as Demographic Parity (DP), defined as $$DP = |P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1)|$$, and Equalized Odds (EO), encompassing equality of opportunity and equal false positive rates, are presented [1,5]. The challenges in translating ethical principles into universally applicable quantifiable metrics and the inherent conflicts between different fairness metrics are discussed, emphasizing the lack of a single metric that captures all dimensions of fairness [1]. The difficulty in applying traditional fairness metrics, primarily designed for classification tasks, to the generative outputs of LLMs is highlighted, pointing to the limitations of current evaluation methods in capturing the complex biases in LLMs when applied to novel domains [1,5]. This discussion underscores the interconnectedness of conceptual clarity and practical implementation in the pursuit of equitable LLMs [7,10].\n\nOverall, this section establishes the theoretical foundations necessary for understanding bias and fairness in LLMs. It highlights the diverse nature of bias, the multifaceted concept of fairness, and the challenges associated with their definition and measurement. The lack of a unified taxonomy for bias and the limitations of current fairness metrics underscore significant research gaps. Future directions should focus on developing more comprehensive and nuanced theoretical frameworks, creating universally applicable definitions and typologies, and devising metrics capable of capturing the complexities of bias and fairness in generative LLMs. The persistent fairness gaps observed even with mitigation strategies indicate a need for deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of bias in LLMs and the development of more effective evaluation and mitigation techniques. Addressing these theoretical challenges is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of equitable LLMs.\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nBias in Large Language Models (LLMs) is predominantly defined as a systematic and unfair deviation or prejudice against certain individuals or groups, often originating from the characteristics of the data used for training [1,3,4,10]. This systematic error can unfairly favor one group while disadvantaging another, manifesting in various forms such as generating stereotypical content, exhibiting prejudice in downstream applications, or reinforcing harmful societal norms [1,10].\n\nSeveral typologies and families of bias have been identified in the context of LLMs. One prominent type is **cognitive bias**, reflecting systematic patterns of deviation from rational judgment, mirroring human cognitive shortcuts [1,4,9]. Beyond this, biases are broadly categorized into families including **statistical bias**, exemplified by oversimplification through averages, and **methodological bias**, arising from inaccuracies in devices or outdated training data [4]. **Socio-historical bias** is also a significant concern, stemming from training data rooted in specific cultural or geographical contexts that may not be universally applicable [4].\n\nMore granular classifications detail specific manifestations of bias. **Social biases**, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases, are frequently cited, often stemming from the over- or under-representation of certain groups and associations in training data [1,3,5,8]. For example, gender bias can appear when LLMs link professions predominantly with one gender based on training data, reinforcing societal stereotypes [3]. **Demographic biases** are linked to attributes like age, nationality, or disability, while **representational biases** concern the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of specific groups [1].\n\nFrom the perspective of their emergence during training and deployment, biases can include **machine bias**, which are biases absorbed from training data containing societal stereotypes and discriminations related to race, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [6]. **Availability bias** occurs when LLMs favor readily accessible content, potentially neglecting less prevalent perspectives and reinforcing existing biases [6]. **Confirmation bias** can appear in training data or user prompts, leading the AI to generate content that aligns with existing beliefs [6]. **Selection bias** arises from non-representative training data, leading to a lack of knowledge for underrepresented groups [6]. **Group attribution bias** involves attributing group characteristics based on individual actions [6]. **Contextual bias** stems from the model's difficulty in accurately interpreting conversational context [6]. **Linguistic bias** favors certain linguistic styles or cultural references, potentially alienating other groups [6]. Finally, **anchoring bias** occurs when the model over-relies on initial information, perpetuating early biases [6]. Bias can also be categorized by its manifestation: **harms of allocation** (unjust resource distribution) and **harms of representation** (reinforcing stereotypes) [4]. Furthermore, bias can be **intrinsic**, residing within the model's internal representations, or **extrinsic**, manifesting in final decisions [4]. Some research also proposes a compositional taxonomy for evaluating bias based on bias types, social groups, and tasks [2].\n\nDespite these various definitions and typologies, the research field faces significant challenges. Defining and categorizing the vast array of biases in LLMs is difficult due to their complex interactions and the nuances of human language and societal structures [1]. A universally agreed-upon taxonomy that comprehensively captures all forms of bias in LLMs is lacking [1]. Existing definitions often provide high-level descriptions without detailed conceptual bases or discussions of how different biases might interact or overlap [4,6]. The lack of a single, accepted definition leads to variations in identification and measurement methodologies [1]. Moreover, while some work highlights social biases, particularly in specific applications like tabular data classification, there remains a need for a more comprehensive understanding and mitigation strategies for these deep-seated biases across different contexts [8]. Existing evaluation efforts often focus on specific bias types, indicating a need for more holistic approaches [2].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nFairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted concept centered on ensuring equitable and non-discriminatory treatment across diverse groups and individuals [1,10]. This fundamental principle aligns with ethical considerations of non-discrimination, equity, and justice [1]. Conceptualizations of fairness often draw from established paradigms in traditional machine learning, including group fairness, which advocates for equal treatment of distinct demographic cohorts, and individual fairness, which emphasizes similar treatment for comparable individuals [1]. The operationalization of these concepts necessitates the use of quantitative metrics for evaluation.\n\n\n<figure-link title='Key Fairness Metrics in LLMs' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Fairness Metrics] --> B(\"Demographic Parity (DP)<br>|P(Ŷ=1|A=0) - P(Ŷ=1|A=1)|\");\\n    A --> C(\"Equalized Odds (EO)\");\\n    C --> D(\"Equality of Opportunity<br>P(Ŷ=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(Ŷ=1|A=1, Y=1)\");\\n    C --> E(\"Equal False Positive Rates<br>P(Ŷ=1|A=0, Y=0) = P(Ŷ=1|A=1, Y=0)\");\\n    A --> F(\"Average Absolute Inequality (AAI)\");'></figure-link>\nSeveral key fairness metrics are employed to assess bias in LLMs. Demographic Parity (DP) quantifies the absolute difference in positive prediction rates between unprivileged and privileged groups, calculated as $$DP = |P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1)|$$, where $\\hat{Y}=1$ represents a positive prediction and $A$ denotes a sensitive attribute [1,5]. Equalized Odds (EO) is a more stringent criterion, requiring equality in both true positive rates and false positive rates across groups. This can be decomposed into two conditions: equality of opportunity, $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=1)$$, and equal false positive rates, $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=0) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=0)$$ [1,5]. The Average Absolute Inequality (AAI) metric provides another perspective by measuring the average absolute difference in outcomes across all possible pairs of groups [5].\n\nDespite the availability of these metrics, defining and measuring fairness in complex LLMs presents significant challenges [1]. The multifaceted nature of fairness makes it difficult to translate ethical principles into universally applicable quantifiable metrics [1]. Critically, there is no single metric capable of capturing all dimensions of fairness, and different metrics often exhibit inherent conflicts, leading to unavoidable trade-offs [1]. This lack of a unified standard is further exacerbated by inconsistent evaluation metrics employed across existing datasets and studies, hindering meaningful comparisons of bias levels across different datasets and LLMs [2].\n\nApplying traditional fairness metrics, primarily designed for classification tasks, to the generative and open-ended outputs of LLMs is particularly challenging [1]. Many conventional metrics are not directly transferable to the nuances of text generation and other complex functionalities [1]. Studies comparing LLMs to traditional ML models on tasks like tabular classification have revealed that LLMs exhibit a larger fairness metric gap between subgroups, even when employing mitigation strategies such as in-context learning and fine-tuning [5,8]. This suggests that current approaches are insufficient to fully address the inherent biases present in LLMs and highlights the limitations of existing evaluation methods in capturing the complex biases in LLMs when applied to novel domains [5,8]. The moderate effects of mitigation strategies observed in empirical studies underscore a gap in understanding the persistence of bias in LLMs despite mitigation attempts [8]. While some frameworks advocate for choosing \"fairness criteria\" as a preliminary step [4], a lack of detailed specification of these criteria and their definitions in certain proposals highlights a need for more concrete guidance in operationalizing fairness in practice [4]. Different definitions of fairness inherently lead to varied evaluation approaches and subsequent mitigation strategies, underscoring the interconnectedness of conceptual clarity and practical implementation in the pursuit of equitable LLMs [7,10].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) represent a class of advanced artificial intelligence systems specifically designed for modeling and processing human language [3,4,7]. These models are typically built upon sophisticated deep learning architectures, predominantly the Transformer model, which excels at understanding context through sequential data analysis [1,3]. The operational principle involves breaking down input text into smaller units called tokens through a process known as tokenization [3]. Subsequently, the model employs complex mathematical equations and probabilistic approaches to discern relationships between these tokens and to predict the most likely next sequence of words, a core mechanism during training [1,3].\n\n\n<figure-link title='LLM Training Data Sources' type='mermaid' content='graph LR\\n    A[LLM Training Data] --> B(\"Internet (Websites, Blogs, etc.)\");\\n    A --> C(\"Books (Digital Libraries)\");\\n    A --> D(\"Other Digital Repositories\");'></figure-link>\nThe training of LLMs is a data-intensive process, necessitating vast quantities of text data drawn from diverse sources such as the internet, books, and other digital repositories [1,3,6,10]. This massive ingestion of data allows the models to comprehend linguistic contexts, nuances, and styles, thereby building a knowledge base capable of mimicking human language [3]. The ability of LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant text is a direct result of learning intricate statistical relationships and patterns embedded within this extensive training data [1].\n\nA critical challenge inherent in LLMs is their propensity for bias, which stems directly from the nature of their training data [3]. LLMs interpret the training data as factual, and consequently, any biases or misinformation present within this data are directly reflected in the model's outputs [3]. The pre-training corpus is a particularly significant source of inherent bias [5,8]. These datasets frequently contain historical, cultural, and societal biases [10], and the sheer scale of the data makes comprehensive curation and filtering to eliminate all forms of bias extremely challenging [1].\n\nBias is not confined to the training data alone but can be introduced and amplified throughout the LLM lifecycle, from data collection through to deployment [1]. The architectural design, the characteristics of the training data, and the generative mechanisms all contribute to specific pathways through which bias can propagate [6,10]. The training process itself, including the selection of optimization objectives, can inadvertently reinforce biased patterns present in the data [1]. Furthermore, emergent properties observed in larger models can lead to unexpected and sometimes biased behaviors [1]. The probabilistic nature of generation, where the model samples from a probability distribution over possible next tokens, also plays a role in reflecting and perpetuating biases learned from the training data [1]. LLMs \"draw upon\" information from their training data when making predictions, and this inheritance of social biases from the pre-training corpus significantly impacts their fairness, including in tasks like tabular prediction [5,8].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nBuilding upon the fundamental concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs), this section examines the origins and propagation of bias throughout their lifecycle. \n<figure-link title='LLM Lifecycle and Bias Propagation Stages' type='mermaid' content='graph LR\\n    A[Data Collection] --> B[Preprocessing];\\n    B --> C[Model Architecture Design];\\n    C --> D[Training];\\n    D --> E[Post-training Adjustments];\\n    E --> F[Deployment/Usage];\\n    A -- Bias Intro/Amplification --> F;\\n    B -- Bias Intro/Amplification --> F;\\n    C -- Bias Intro/Amplification --> F;\\n    D -- Bias Intro/Amplification --> F;\\n    E -- Bias Intro/Amplification --> F;'></figure-link>\nBias in LLMs is a multifaceted issue, arising from various stages of development and deployment, including data collection, preprocessing, model architecture design, training procedures, post-training adjustments, and how the models are ultimately utilized in real-world applications [1,4,10].\n\nA primary source of bias is the vast amount of data used for pre-training LLMs, which often reflects societal stereotypes, historical inequities, and prejudiced language present in the real world [1,3,6,8]. This means that social biases are directly inherited from the pre-training corpus, embedding them within the model's parameters and internal representations [4,5,8]. Data biases can manifest as overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain groups, leading to skewed outputs [10].\n\nBeyond data, biases can also be introduced or amplified during the model architecture design and training process. While architectures like the Transformer are not inherently biased, the choice of objective functions and optimization algorithms can incentivize the model to reproduce biased patterns present in the data [1]. Inductive biases from the architecture also influence how biases are learned and manifested [1,4]. The adaptation process, including alignment and specialization, can further contribute to bias introduction [4].\n\nThe post-training stages, including fine-tuning on task-specific datasets and deployment scenarios, also play a crucial role in bias propagation [1]. Fine-tuning on biased data can amplify existing biases or introduce new ones [1]. Furthermore, the way LLMs are used, particularly the nature of user prompts and the context of deployment, significantly influences the manifestation of bias, potentially leading to harms of allocation or representation [1,4].\n\nThe interplay between data biases and algorithmic biases is complex. Biased data forms the foundation upon which algorithms learn, and the algorithms themselves can reinforce or even exacerbate these biases through their specific mechanisms and optimization goals. Bias mitigation techniques applied at different stages of the LLM lifecycle aim to counteract these propagated biases, but their effectiveness varies depending on the source and nature of the bias. The following subsections will delve into the specific sources and mechanisms of bias propagation at each stage of the LLM lifecycle, providing a detailed examination of how bias is introduced and perpetuated from data collection through to deployment.\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nBias in Large Language Models (LLMs) originates significantly from the data collection and preprocessing phases [1,3,4,6,8]. The sheer scale of pre-training datasets for LLMs is identified as a primary source of bias [4]. These massive datasets, often scraped from the internet, inherently contain societal stereotypes, historical biases, and prejudiced language [1]. This means that social biases are directly inherited from the pre-training corpus [8].\n\n\n<figure-link title='Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias Mechanisms' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Data Bias] --> B(\"Over/Underrepresentation of Groups\");\\n    A --> C(\"Western-centric Content\");\\n    A --> D(\"Availability Bias\");\\n    A --> E(\"Selection Bias\");\\n    A --> F(\"Anchoring Bias\");\\n    A --> G(\"Outdated Data\");'></figure-link>\nSpecific mechanisms of bias propagation during these stages include the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain groups, leading to skewed outputs [10]. For instance, datasets predominantly composed of Western-centric texts can result in models that favor Western perspectives [10]. This is a form of socio-historical bias, where training data from a single country can embed specific worldviews that are then applied globally [4]. Availability bias further contributes to this by favoring readily available content and potentially neglecting less prevalent perspectives [6]. Selection bias emerges when the training data is not representative, resulting in a lack of knowledge about underrepresented groups, hindering the generation of unbiased content for them [6]. Anchoring bias can also occur if the model relies too heavily on initial biased information present in the training data [6].\n\nEmpirical observations support these claims. Associations between professions and genders, such as \"nurse\" with female and \"engineer\" with male, are prevalent in large text corpora, and LLMs trained on such data reflect these stereotypes in their outputs [1,3]. Methodological bias can also arise from using datasets that are not current, reflecting outdated information and potentially perpetuating historical inaccuracies or stereotypes [4]. Preprocessing steps themselves, such as tokenization or filtering, can inadvertently amplify or introduce biases [1].\n\nWhile the impact of data bias is widely acknowledged [1,4,6], the precise severity and pervasiveness of bias originating specifically from data collection and preprocessing, compared to other stages, are difficult to quantify definitively based on the provided digests. The sheer scale and diversity of internet data make it extremely challenging to identify and remove all sources of bias during these initial stages [1].\n\nCritiques of existing work highlight significant limitations in understanding and addressing these biases. Although papers mention that biases arise from datasets, specific examples, detailed mechanisms of bias introduction, and statistical observations are often lacking [4]. There is a need for a more detailed understanding of how different types of data bias, such as representational and historical biases, manifest and interact [6]. Furthermore, developing effective and scalable methods for identifying and mitigating bias in massive, heterogeneous datasets remains an open challenge [1]. Data cleaning and augmentation techniques, while employed, can be computationally expensive and may not fully address deeply embedded biases [1]. There is also a lack of detailed discussion on specific preprocessing techniques and their mechanisms for mitigating bias [6]. This gap impacts the current state of practice by making it difficult to implement targeted and effective interventions at the data collection and preprocessing stages.\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nBias in Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by factors related to model architecture and the training process. While the Transformer architecture, commonly used in LLMs, is not inherently biased, biases present in the training data can be reinforced and propagated through specific aspects of the training process [1]. A primary mechanism of bias propagation is the pretraining phase, where LLMs are exposed to massive datasets that often contain societal biases [5,8]. These inherent biases within the pretraining corpus become embedded within the LLMs themselves [5,8].\n\n\n<figure-link title='Model Architecture and Training Bias Mechanisms' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Model/Training Bias] --> B(\"Objective Function (Next-Token Prediction)\");\\n    A --> C(\"Inductive Biases (Architecture)\");\\n    A --> D(\"Optimization Algorithms\");\\n    A --> E(\"Adaptation Process (Alignment)\");\\n    A --> F(\"Group Attribution Bias\");'></figure-link>\nThe objective functions employed during training, such as next-token prediction, can inadvertently incentivize the model to reproduce the patterns and associations found in biased data [1]. This means that if biased language is prevalent in the training data, the model is likely to learn and generate similar biased outputs [1]. Furthermore, inductive biases introduced by the model architecture and the choice of optimization algorithms also contribute to how biases are learned and manifested within the model's internal representations [1,4]. The adaptation process, which involves aligning the model with human values and specialization, can also introduce biases [4].\n\nEmpirical findings support the claim that biases are inherent within LLMs and inherited from their pretraining data [5,8]. These biases stemming from the pretraining process present a significant challenge as they are not easily mitigated by downstream techniques such as finetuning or in-context learning [5]. Group attribution bias, for instance, can emerge during training when the AI attributes characteristics to an entire group based on limited examples [6]. Training on diverse datasets that accurately reflect the complexities of different groups is proposed as a strategy to mitigate this type of bias [6].\n\nDespite these observations, a comprehensive understanding of the precise mechanisms by which model architecture and training procedures contribute to bias propagation remains complex and necessitates further research [1]. Critiques highlight that while architecture choices and the adaptation process are mentioned as sources of bias, specific examples, detailed mechanisms, or empirical observations of bias introduction during model design or training are often lacking [4,6]. Similarly, although the scale of pretraining data is identified as a contributing factor, detailed mechanisms beyond sheer scale are not consistently provided [4]. Developing training techniques that are inherently more robust to data bias while maintaining model performance is a significant technical challenge [1]. The intricate internal workings of large neural networks also pose a practical difficulty in pinpointing exactly how and why biases are learned and propagated during training [1]. These limitations in understanding the granular details of bias introduction during model architecture and training impact the current state of practice, making it challenging to design and implement truly fairness-aware training algorithms.\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nBias in Large Language Models (LLMs) is not solely a consequence of pre-training data or architectural design; it can also emerge or intensify during post-training procedures and deployment scenarios [1]. A significant causal link exists between fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets and the amplification or introduction of new biases. If the fine-tuning data is not rigorously curated, it can embed specific biases into the model, even if the base model exhibited relatively low bias [1]. This propagation mechanism highlights the vulnerability of LLMs to data biases at later stages of development.\n\n\n<figure-link title='Post-training and Deployment Bias Manifestations' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Post-training/Deployment Bias] --> B(\"Fine-tuning on Biased Data\");\\n    A --> C(\"Inappropriate Usage\");\\n    A --> D(\"User Prompts\");\\n    A --> E(\"Contextual Bias\");\\n    A --> F(\"Linguistic Bias\");\\n    A --> G(\"Automation Bias\");'></figure-link>\nBeyond fine-tuning, the manner in which LLMs are utilized during deployment profoundly influences the manifestation of bias [1,4]. Inappropriate usage and the specific nature of user prompts can elicit biased responses, leading to harms of allocation or representation [4]. This is an instance of extrinsic bias, where bias is observed in the final decisions or outputs of the model [4]. For example, a biased prompt can intentionally or unintentionally trigger stereotypical outputs from an LLM [1]. Contextual bias, where the model misinterprets the prompt's context, can also lead to inappropriate and potentially biased responses [6]. Furthermore, linguistic bias can render content less accessible or relatable to certain linguistic groups [6]. A critical deployment concern is automation bias, where users unquestioningly accept AI outputs, potentially amplifying the spread of false or biased information [6].\n\nEmpirical findings underscore the persistence of bias even after post-training interventions. Studies investigating the fairness of LLMs for tabular data prediction demonstrate that techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning, while having a moderate effect on fairness, do not eliminate the significant bias gap observed when compared to traditional machine learning models [5,8]. The observation that standard in-context learning and fine-tuning are not fully effective in mitigating inherent biases suggests that these biases are deeply embedded and manifest during deployment, despite efforts at later-stage correction [8]. However, interventions like label-flipping of in-context examples have shown promise in reducing biases, indicating that the specific examples and their framing during deployment can influence bias manifestation [8]. Techniques like post-generation self-diagnosis, involving specific instructions to guide the model towards fairer outputs, and careful prompt engineering, including roleplay and temperature adjustment, have been proposed to reveal and mitigate certain biases during deployment [4].\n\nComparing the severity and pervasiveness of bias originating from this stage is challenging due to limitations in current understanding. While fine-tuning on biased data presents a clear mechanism for introducing or amplifying bias, the pervasiveness of bias in deployment is highly dependent on the specific application, user interaction patterns, and the nature of the prompts [1,4]. The diverse range of potential LLM applications makes anticipating and preventing all forms of bias manifestation in deployment difficult [1]. Critiques highlight that addressing bias solely at the deployment stage is often reactive and may not fully counteract the harm caused by biased outputs [1]. Furthermore, while some studies detail prompt engineering and post-generation self-diagnosis, they may not extensively cover other mechanisms of bias manifestation during deployment or the influence of user interaction patterns [4]. There is a recognized gap in understanding the detailed mechanisms of how deployment biases like automation bias fully manifest post-training and how user interaction design or deployment platforms could mitigate or exacerbate these issues [6]. The moderate effect of in-context learning on fairness also suggests that simply providing unbiased examples during inference is insufficient to counteract the strong, inherent biases within the LLM [5]. The current state of understanding indicates that while post-training and deployment interventions can offer some mitigation, they are not a panacea for addressing inherent biases, and the dynamic nature of user interaction poses ongoing challenges for ensuring fairness in real-world LLM applications [1].\n## 5.

Accurate and comprehensive evaluation is a fundamental step in understanding the limitations of LLMs and subsequently developing effective mitigation strategies [1]. This section outlines the existing evaluation landscape, summarizing common benchmarks and methodologies employed for this purpose. It analyzes their strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and compositional benchmarks, particularly as suggested by [2]. The discussion also compares evaluation methods used across different studies and their applicability to diverse types of bias, such as those related to demographic groups or task-specific outcomes [5,8]. Furthermore, a critical aspect explored is the inherent trade-offs between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties, including performance, efficiency, and usability, throughout the evaluation process [5]. The subsequent subsections provide a more detailed examination of benchmark datasets, fairness metrics and methodologies, and the challenges and limitations inherent in the current evaluation landscape.\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\n<figure-link title='Types of Bias Evaluation Benchmarks' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Bias Evaluation Benchmarks] --> B(\"Specific Bias Benchmarks<br>(e.g., Gender, Race, Religion)\");\\n    B --> C(\"BBQ (Bold Bias Dataset)\");\\n    B --> D(\"CrowS-Pairs\");\\n    B --> E(\"StereoSet\");\\n    B --> F(\"WinoBias\");\\n    B --> G(\"WinoGender\");\\n    A --> H(\"Compositional Benchmarks<br>(Multiple Bias Types, Groups, Tasks)\");\\n    H --> I(\"Compositional Evaluation Benchmark (CEB)\");'></figure-link>\nThe evaluation of fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically relies on the development and application of robust benchmark datasets. Benchmarks typically consist of a test dataset and metrics tailored to specific Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, designed to assess model quality and effectiveness based on objective and reproducible criteria [4]. However, the efficacy of these benchmarks is intrinsically linked to the characteristics of the test data itself, which can introduce biases and consequently impact the validity of the evaluation [4]. The process of developing a benchmark is comprehensive, involving data collection, annotation, task definition, and the establishment of appropriate evaluation metrics [4].\n\nA significant limitation of many existing bias evaluation datasets is their focus on a particular type of bias, hindering a holistic assessment of fairness across the diverse dimensions of bias that LLMs can exhibit [1,2]. For instance, prominent benchmarks such as BBQ (Bold Bias Dataset), CrowS-Pairs, StereoSet, WinoBias, and WinoGender are designed to measure specific social biases like those related to gender, race, and religion, often employing distinct metrics like the Stereotypical Score in CrowS-Pairs to quantify observed bias [1]. While these benchmarks provide valuable insights into particular bias facets, they often fail to capture the full spectrum of biases and their intersections across different demographic groups [1]. This highlights a critical need for more comprehensive and dynamic benchmarks capable of evaluating bias in diverse applications and across various demographic intersections [1].\n\nIn response to this limitation, compositional benchmarks have been proposed to address the need for a more comprehensive evaluation strategy [2]. The Compositional Evaluation Benchmark (CEB), for example, is designed based on a compositional taxonomy that encompasses various bias types, social groups, and tasks [2]. By integrating a variety of existing datasets, CEB aims to provide a more thorough evaluation of LLM fairness. Experimental results using CEB demonstrate that bias levels can vary significantly across different dimensions of this taxonomy, underscoring the value of a compositional approach to evaluation [2].\n\nFurthermore, current evaluation methods exhibit gaps concerning certain types of biases or LLM applications, particularly in domains like tabular data analysis. While traditional benchmarks often focus on language-based tasks, the application of LLMs to structured data necessitates tailored evaluation methods [8]. Studies evaluating LLM fairness on tabular data, even without explicitly calling the datasets \"benchmarks\" in the traditional sense, reveal that LLMs can exhibit larger fairness metric gaps between subgroups compared to traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks [5,8]. This suggests a gap in existing evaluation methodologies specifically designed for assessing fairness in LLMs applied to structured data [5].\n\nThe critiques of existing benchmarks highlight several limitations that impact the current state of understanding and practice in fairness evaluation. The reliance on human annotations, which can introduce subjectivity and bias, is a notable challenge [1]. Moreover, the dynamic nature of LLMs and their evolving capabilities pose difficulties for static benchmarks, emphasizing the need for benchmarks that can adapt to these changes [1].\n\nA critical consideration when employing these benchmarks is the inherent trade-off between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties, such as overall performance, efficiency, and usability. Evaluating and mitigating bias through benchmarking may necessitate modifications to the model that could potentially impact these other attributes. For instance, techniques aimed at improving fairness on a benchmark might lead to a decrease in accuracy on certain tasks or an increase in computational cost [5]. Therefore, researchers and practitioners must carefully navigate these trade-offs when utilizing benchmarks to guide the development and deployment of fair LLMs. The need for compositional benchmarks is further underscored by the necessity to evaluate how fairness interventions impact performance across a diverse set of tasks and demographic groups [2].\n\nWhile numerous benchmarks exist, focusing on specific bias types, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive, standardized, and dynamic benchmarks that can evaluate fairness across diverse demographic groups, tasks, and languages. Future benchmark development should aim to address the limitations of current methods, particularly regarding the evaluation of fairness in LLMs applied to structured data and the need for adaptability to the evolving nature of these models.\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nAssessing fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates the application of diverse metrics and methodologies, often adapted from traditional machine learning fairness frameworks [1]. These approaches typically quantify bias through disparities in performance or output distributions across distinct demographic groups [1]. \n<figure-link title='Fairness Evaluation Methodologies' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Fairness Evaluation Methodologies] --> B(\"Analyze Model Outputs\");\\n    B --> C(\"Stereotypical Associations\");\\n    B --> D(\"Harmful Language\");\\n    B --> E(\"Discriminatory Behaviors\");\\n    A --> F(\"Intrinsic Methods (Internal Representations)\");\\n    A --> G(\"Extrinsic Methods (Task Performance)\");\\n    A --> H(\"Association Tests\");\\n    A --> I(\"Counterfactual Evaluation\");\\n    A --> J(\"Performance Disparity Metrics\");'></figure-link>\nMethodologies employed for this assessment include analyzing model outputs for stereotypical associations, harmful language, or discriminatory behaviors in specific tasks [1]. Examples of specific metrics used include Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Odds (EO), and Average Absolute Inequality (AAI), particularly in the context of LLMs applied to tabular data classification tasks [5,8]. These metrics are computed based on model predictions and sensitive attributes within the data [5].\n\nEvaluation methodologies for LLM fairness can be broadly categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic methods [4]. Intrinsic methods analyze the model's internal representations, such as relationships between words or probability assignments to words [4]. Extrinsic methods, conversely, evaluate model performance on specific tasks using relevant metrics [4]. Traditional NLP task-specific metrics and benchmarks are also utilized to measure LLM quality on reference datasets or generated text [4]. Beyond these, other methodologies include association tests to quantify the link between sensitive attributes and stereotypical concepts, counterfactual evaluation to examine output changes upon altering sensitive attributes, and performance disparity metrics to assess differences in performance across demographic groups [1]. These often adapt metrics from traditional fairness literature, such as statistical parity or equalized odds [1]. Comprehensive evaluation often benefits from a combination of human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or hybrid approaches [3]. Metrics such as accuracy, sentiment, and fairness indicators (e.g., false positives and false negatives) provide valuable feedback for identifying bias and improving LLM outputs [3].\n\nHowever, applying traditional fairness metrics to the complex and generative outputs of LLMs presents significant challenges [1]. Many existing metrics are designed for classification tasks and may not be directly applicable to the unstructured nature of text generation [1]. Defining and objectively measuring fairness for open-ended text generation remains an open research problem, complicated by the subjectivity and context-dependence of what constitutes a \"fair\" output [1].\n\nExperimental results highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods. Studies comparing LLMs to traditional models on tabular data classification, even using standard metrics like DP, EO, and AAI, demonstrate a larger fairness metric gap between different subgroups for LLMs [8]. This indicates that bias is deeply rooted in LLMs and not easily captured or addressed by applying standard metrics alone without effective mitigation strategies [5]. The persistent gap even after mitigation suggests limitations in current evaluation methodologies or the need for more sensitive metrics [8]. Furthermore, existing bias evaluation efforts often employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, hindering effective comparison across different datasets and studies [2].\n\nThese critiques underscore the necessity for robust and standardized methods for bias identification and more comprehensive evaluation frameworks [2,3]. There are significant gaps in current evaluation methods regarding certain types of biases or LLM applications, emphasizing the need for future benchmark development and methodological advancements [2,5]. The development of compositional evaluation benchmarks, as suggested by the title of [2], appears crucial for a more systematic and comparable assessment of bias across different dimensions. The challenges in developing comprehensive and universally accepted metrics stem from the inherent complexity of defining fairness in the context of language and the diverse ways bias can manifest in LLM outputs. While multiple methods and metrics are necessary to capture the multifaceted nature of bias [3], there is a need for more detailed investigation into the mathematical formulations and specific challenges associated with defining and measuring complex societal biases with quantitative metrics.\n\nFinally, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent trade-offs between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties, such as overall performance, efficiency, and usability, when applying various fairness metrics and methodologies [5]. Evaluating these trade-offs is essential for developing practical and effective fairness interventions.\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\n<figure-link title='Challenges in LLM Fairness Evaluation' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Evaluation Challenges] --> B(\"Lack of Standardized Metrics/Frameworks\");\\n    A --> C(\"Difficulty Defining/Measuring Complex Biases\");\\n    A --> D(\"Dynamic/Evolving Nature of LLMs\");\\n    A --> E(\"Scalability Challenges\");\\n    A --> F(\"Partial View of Bias (Current Methods)\");\\n    A --> G(\"Suitability of Benchmarks (Potential Bias)\");\\n    A --> H(\"Limitations for Novel Applications (e.g., Tabular)\");'></figure-link>\nEvaluating bias and fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complex endeavor, fraught with significant challenges and limitations [1]. A primary difficulty stems from the lack of standardized metrics and evaluation frameworks [1,2]. There is no universal set of metrics applicable across all LLM applications and types of bias, hindering consistent comparison of results across different studies [1]. Furthermore, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on specific types of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, further impeding comparability [2].\n\nAnother significant challenge lies in the inherent difficulty of defining and measuring complex societal biases, which are often nuanced, context-dependent, and intersecting [1]. Capturing these multifaceted biases through quantitative metrics is particularly challenging [1]. The dynamic and evolving nature of LLMs also means that biases can manifest in novel and unpredictable ways, making it difficult to develop evaluation methods that remain relevant and effective over time [1]. The sheer scale of LLMs and their training data necessitates significant computational resources for comprehensive evaluation, posing scalability challenges [1].\n\nCritiques of existing work highlight that current evaluation methods often provide only a partial view of LLM bias, frequently focusing on specific types of bias or tasks [1]. The difficulty in detecting biases that may be concealed by general metrics is underscored by observations regarding fairness indicators [3]. The suitability of benchmark datasets themselves is a key issue, as they can introduce their own biases, raising concerns about the validity of evaluations [4].\n\nFurthermore, research applying LLMs to non-traditional tasks, such as tabular classification, has revealed limitations in current evaluation approaches to fully capture and address the inherent biases in LLMs [5,8]. Even with mitigation strategies, the fairness gap in LLMs applied to tabular data remains larger than in traditional ML models, suggesting that existing metrics are insufficient to fully understand the source and persistence of bias [5]. The fact that standard in-context learning and fine-tuning did not eliminate this fairness gap further indicates that current evaluation methods, while capable of detecting bias, may not be sufficient to fully measure the extent of these deeply embedded biases [8]. These findings suggest a need for evaluation methods that can better probe the underlying mechanisms of bias in LLMs, particularly in novel applications [5].\n\nThe limitations in current evaluation methods, particularly the lack of comprehensive coverage of bias types and inconsistent metrics, point to a clear need for future benchmark development and methodological advancements [2]. Developing robust and comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can capture the multifaceted nature of bias in LLMs remains an ongoing challenge [1]. This includes addressing gaps in current evaluation methods regarding specific types of biases and LLM applications [2,5].\n\nFinally, discussions surrounding evaluation must acknowledge the inherent trade-offs between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties such as performance, efficiency, and usability [5]. Evaluating fairness in isolation without considering these trade-offs provides an incomplete picture of the practical challenges in developing and deploying fair LLMs.\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nFollowing the discussion on evaluation, this section explores the various techniques developed to address bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). \n<figure-link title='Categories of LLM Bias Mitigation Strategies' type='mermaid' content='graph LR\\n    A[Bias Mitigation Strategies] --> B[Data-Centric];\\n    A --> C[Model-Centric];\\n    A --> D[Post-Processing];'></figure-link>\nMitigation strategies can be categorized based on their general approach or the stage of the LLM lifecycle they target: data-centric, model-centric, and post-processing techniques [1]. These methods aim to reduce biased outputs by manipulating training data, modifying the model or its training process, or adjusting the generated output [1]. This section provides a general overview and transitions to the subsequent subsections, which will delve into the specifics of each category of mitigation strategy. A critical aspect of implementing these strategies is understanding the trade-offs between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties such as performance, efficiency, and usability [4,5].\n\nData-centric mitigation focuses on curating and manipulating the training data to reduce the model's exposure to biased patterns. This involves techniques such as data filtering, data augmentation, and data reweighting to create more balanced and representative datasets [1,3]. The goal is to build inclusive datasets with diverse demographics, languages, and cultures [3,6]. While conceptually sound, applying these techniques to the massive datasets used for LLMs presents significant scalability challenges and requires sophisticated infrastructure [1].\n\nModel-centric mitigation techniques involve modifying the LLM or its training process. Key approaches include fine-tuning on debiased or task-specific datasets [3,8], incorporating fairness-aware training objectives, and using adversarial training or reinforcement learning from human feedback [1]. Integrating logical reasoning into models has also been explored to promote neutrality [3]. While promising, studies suggest that fine-tuning alone may not fully eliminate deeply embedded biases from pre-training [5,8], and these methods can be computationally expensive [1].\n\nPost-processing techniques are applied after the LLM generates output and do not require modifying the model parameters [1]. These include output reranking, bias correction mechanisms, prompt engineering, and post-generation self-diagnosis [1,4]. Prompt engineering, in particular, through careful formulation, can encourage unbiased outputs and expose biases via roleplay or optimization based on benchmarks [4,6]. In-context learning, treated as an inference-time intervention, has shown that manipulating input examples can influence bias reduction, as demonstrated by label-flipping of in-context examples [5,8]. However, post-processing acts as a filter and may not address the root causes of bias within the model [1].\n\nA significant challenge across all mitigation strategies is the complex trade-off between achieving fairness and maintaining model performance, efficiency, and usability [1,3,4,5]. Debiasing efforts may sometimes degrade accuracy or introduce new biases [4]. The difficulty in reconciling multiple fairness criteria simultaneously also poses a notable challenge [1]. Empirical studies comparing LLMs to traditional ML models highlight that even with mitigation, LLMs can still exhibit larger fairness gaps, indicating the persistence of biases inherited from pre-training [5,8]. The scalability of these techniques and the lack of a unified framework for systematic comparison also represent key limitations [1]. Future research needs to focus on developing more robust, scalable, and less resource-intensive methods that effectively manage these inherent trade-offs. Collaboration between AI and human decision-making, coupled with critical engagement with LLM outputs, is also important in mitigating cognitive biases [9]. The exploration of fairness standards plays a crucial role in guiding these mitigation efforts [7].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nData-centric mitigation is recognized as a crucial approach to addressing bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily by manipulating the training data [1,3]. The fundamental principle is to reduce the model's exposure to biased patterns during the training phase [1]. Companies bear significant responsibility for the nature of data incorporated into these models, emphasizing the need for curated datasets derived from diverse sources to balance representation and mitigate bias [3]. Such diversity, encompassing different demographics, languages, and cultures, is also instrumental in guiding targeted model fine-tuning efforts [3].\n\n\n<figure-link title='Data-Centric Mitigation Techniques' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Data-Centric Mitigation] --> B(\"Data Filtering\");\\n    A --> C(\"Data Augmentation\");\\n    A --> D(\"Data Reweighting\");\\n    A --> E(\"Curating Inclusive Datasets\");\\n    A --> F(\"Label-flipping in In-Context Learning\");'></figure-link>\nSpecific techniques for data curation and manipulation to reduce bias include data filtering, data augmentation, and data reweighting [1]. Data filtering involves removing biased or undesirable content from the training corpus, while data augmentation aims to create more balanced and representative datasets by enhancing underrepresented groups or perspectives [1]. Data reweighting adjusts the importance of training examples, giving more weight to underrepresented or sensitive groups [1]. Curating inclusive and representative datasets with transparent guidelines for data collection is considered a critical initial step to identify and minimize biases [6]. Training on diverse datasets that capture the complexities of different groups is deemed necessary to prevent biases such as group attribution bias [6]. Furthermore, careful curation of the initial information provided to the model can help prevent anchoring bias [6].\n\nWhile the primary focus of data-centric methods lies in pre-training data, these approaches can also be applied during in-context learning. For instance, label-flipping of in-context examples has been shown to significantly reduce biases in LLMs when making predictions on tabular data [8]. This demonstrates that modifying the input examples provided to the LLM can influence its output bias, highlighting the potential of data-centric methods beyond the initial training phase [8]. The empirical result from this study, showing a significant reduction in bias through label-flipping, supports the notion that manipulating data, even at the inference stage, can be an effective mitigation strategy [8].\n\nDespite the conceptual appeal and demonstrated potential in specific cases like in-context learning, scaling data-centric mitigation techniques to the massive datasets used for training LLMs presents significant computational and logistical challenges [1]. Identifying and quantifying all forms of bias in such large-scale datasets is inherently difficult [1]. Critiques highlight the lack of specific techniques for achieving inclusivity and representativeness at this scale and the absence of empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of these data-centric approaches on large models [6]. Data augmentation and filtering, while valuable, may not fully eliminate deeply embedded biases and, in some cases, could inadvertently introduce new ones [1]. The challenges in curating truly unbiased and representative datasets are substantial, given the sheer volume of data involved in LLM training [1].\n\nThe transferability and scalability of these data-centric mitigation techniques across different LLM sizes, architectures, and application domains remain significant areas of inquiry. While the principle of reducing biased exposure during training is universally applicable, the practical implementation of techniques like data filtering and reweighting on models with billions or trillions of parameters is computationally intensive and requires sophisticated infrastructure. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a specific data-centric method in addressing one type of bias or in one application domain may not directly translate to others, highlighting the need for tailored approaches and further research into the generalizability of these techniques [3,5].\n\nAchieving multiple fairness goals simultaneously through data-centric methods also poses challenges, as interventions aimed at mitigating one type of bias might negatively impact others or affect overall model performance and efficiency. There exists a critical trade-off between enhancing fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties such as performance, efficiency, and usability when implementing data-centric mitigation strategies [5]. The lack of comprehensive experimental results and comparative data on the effectiveness of different data-centric techniques within the context of large-scale LLMs necessitates further empirical investigation [1]. The critiques underscore the need for more concrete demonstrations of how data-centric methods perform in practice on diverse datasets and model architectures.\n\nIn summary, data-centric mitigation is a fundamental approach to addressing bias in LLMs by focusing on the quality and representativeness of the training data. While techniques like data filtering, augmentation, and reweighting hold promise, their scalability to the massive datasets used for LLM training is a significant challenge. The effectiveness of these methods across different biases and application domains requires further investigation, and there is a recognized need for more empirical evidence and detailed comparative analyses. The inherent trade-offs between fairness and other model properties also necessitate careful consideration and potentially the development of more sophisticated techniques that can balance these competing objectives.\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nModel-centric mitigation techniques aim to reduce bias by modifying the Large Language Model (LLM) or its training process [1]. \n<figure-link title='Model-Centric Mitigation Techniques' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Model-Centric Mitigation] --> B(\"Fine-tuning\");\\n    B --> C(\"On Debiased Datasets\");\\n    B --> D(\"On Task-Specific Datasets\");\\n    A --> E(\"Counterfactual Data Augmentation\");\\n    A --> F(\"Fairness-Aware Training Objectives\");\\n    A --> G(\"Adversarial Training\");\\n    A --> H(\"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\");\\n    A --> I(\"Integrating Logical Reasoning\");'></figure-link>\nA primary strategy within this category is fine-tuning, which involves further training a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, potentially debiased or task-specific dataset to adapt its parameters and reduce bias [3,8]. This process helps the model better comprehend context and avoid generating contextually inappropriate or biased content [6].\n\nDifferent fine-tuning approaches can be employed to mitigate specific types of bias [3]. For instance, transfer learning allows a general text pre-trained model to be fine-tuned on specialized datasets, such as legal documentation, to improve accuracy and reduce biases within that domain [3]. Counterfactual data augmentation is another technique used in conjunction with fine-tuning. This involves altering training data to disrupt stereotypical associations, which can be effective in reducing gender, racial, or cultural biases by breaking spurious correlations in the data [3]. A distinct approach involves integrating logical reasoning into LLMs. One study demonstrated that a \"neutral language model\" considering relationships between tokens neutrally, without explicit logic during pre-training, resulted in less biased models without requiring additional data or algorithm training [3]. This logic-aware approach helps to prevent the production of harmful stereotypes [3].\n\nBeyond fine-tuning, other model-centric strategies include fairness-aware training objectives, which incorporate fairness constraints or regularization terms into the training process, and adversarial training, which aims to make the model more robust against attacks designed to expose bias [1]. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is another method that fine-tunes models based on human preferences that penalize biased outputs, aligning the model with desired values [1,4]. These methods collectively aim to influence the model's internal representations or generation process to promote less biased outcomes [1].\n\nExperimental results provide insights into the effectiveness of these approaches. Studies investigating fine-tuning for bias mitigation have shown a moderate effect on reducing bias metrics, such as the fairness gap between subgroups in tabular classification tasks [5,8]. However, the fairness gap in LLMs often remains larger than that observed in traditional machine learning models, suggesting that addressing bias solely at the fine-tuning stage may not be sufficient to overcome the deeply embedded biases inherited from the pretraining phase [5,8]. Conversely, the MIT CSAIL study on integrating logic into LLMs demonstrated a notable reduction in bias in the newly trained model without the need for increased data or additional algorithm training [3].\n\nDespite the potential, model-centric mitigation techniques face several challenges and trade-offs. A significant limitation is the moderate effectiveness of techniques like fine-tuning in fully eliminating pre-training biases [5,8]. This suggests that a comprehensive approach requires addressing bias at multiple stages of the LLM lifecycle, not just post-pretraining. Model-centric methods can be complex to implement and may not guarantee fairness across all types of bias and sensitive attributes [1]. Furthermore, these techniques often require significant computational resources and expertise to implement and tune, impacting their scalability, particularly for very large models [1,4].\n\nA critical trade-off exists between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties, such as overall performance, efficiency, and usability [1,5]. Techniques aimed at reducing bias might inadvertently degrade performance on neutral data or introduce new biases stemming from the specific data used for mitigation or the alignment process itself [4]. The transferability of these mitigation techniques across different LLM sizes, architectures, and application domains is also a subject of ongoing research. The effectiveness of a method on one model or task may not directly translate to another, highlighting the need for careful evaluation and adaptation. Finally, the interpretability of how these techniques reduce bias in complex, black-box LLMs remains limited, posing challenges for understanding the mechanisms and ensuring reliable fairness outcomes [1]. The current state of bias management in LLMs is not yet fully mature, reflecting these limitations and the need for further research and development in robust and scalable model-centric mitigation strategies [4].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPost-processing techniques represent a class of bias mitigation strategies applied after a Large Language Model (LLM) has generated its output, without requiring modification of the underlying model parameters [1]. \n<figure-link title='Post-Processing Mitigation Techniques' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Post-Processing Mitigation] --> B(\"Output Reranking\");\\n    A --> C(\"Bias Correction Mechanisms\");\\n    A --> D(\"Prompt Engineering\");\\n    A --> E(\"Post-Generation Self-Diagnosis\");\\n    A --> F(\"In-Context Learning (Inference-time)\");\\n    F --> G(\"Label-flipping of In-Context Examples\");'></figure-link>\nThis approach includes methodologies such as output reranking based on predefined fairness criteria and bias correction mechanisms that modify the generated text to reduce prejudiced language [1]. A key advantage of these techniques lies in their relative simplicity, lower expertise requirements, and ease of implementation compared to pre-training or fine-tuning interventions [4].\n\nSpecific post-processing methods include prompt engineering and post-generation self-diagnosis [4]. Prompt engineering, through the careful formulation of prompts, can encourage the model to consider diverse perspectives and avoid stereotypical outputs [4]. Techniques like roleplay within prompts can further expose and mitigate biases [4]. Optimizing prompts by evaluating model outputs on benchmarks with different prompts is a practical step in managing bias, as model performance is sensitive to prompt parameters such as temperature, instructions, context, examples, and system prompts [4]. Post-generation self-diagnosis involves instructing the model to evaluate its own output against criteria such as bias, stereotyping, and toxicity, and subsequently adjust or regenerate responses if necessary [1]. This requires the model to validate the revised output before final presentation [4].\n\nIn-context learning can also be viewed as an inference-time or deployment-time intervention that influences model behavior through provided examples [5,8]. Experimental results suggest that while in-context learning has a moderate effect on fairness, strategies such as label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce bias metrics [5]. This highlights the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt-based interventions but also underscores the need to address the underlying biases within the model itself [5].\n\nDespite their accessibility, post-processing techniques face limitations. A primary critique is that they act as a filter on the output rather than addressing the root causes of bias embedded within the model's architecture and training data [1]. This reactive approach may not fully remove complex biases and can sometimes result in outputs that are unnatural or nonsensical [1]. The effectiveness of post-processing techniques can vary, and they may not generalize well across different tasks and types of bias [1]. Furthermore, achieving multiple fairness goals simultaneously through post-processing can be challenging [5]. While some papers describe post-processing techniques, they often lack detailed methodologies, frameworks, or empirical evidence comparing their effectiveness in reducing bias across different methods [1,4,6].\n\nThe transferability and scalability of post-processing techniques across different LLM sizes, architectures, and application domains present practical difficulties [5,10]. While prompt engineering and self-diagnosis are generally applicable, their optimal configuration can be model-specific and require extensive experimentation. The lack of detailed empirical comparisons of post-processing techniques in existing literature represents a gap in understanding their relative effectiveness and trade-offs [4]. Continuous monitoring and auditing of AI-generated outputs are suggested as necessary steps, but detailed methodologies for effectively performing these post-processing steps and automated techniques for debiasing outputs are often not provided [6].\n\nCrucially, there are inherent trade-offs between achieving fairness and maintaining other desirable model properties such as performance, efficiency, and usability when applying post-processing techniques [5]. Aggressive bias correction might alter the meaning or naturalness of the generated text, potentially impacting usability. The computational overhead of post-generation analysis or multiple regeneration steps could affect efficiency, particularly for real-time applications. Therefore, the selection and implementation of post-processing techniques require careful consideration of these trade-offs within the specific application context.\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\n<figure-link title='Challenges and Trade-offs in Bias Mitigation' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Mitigation Challenges/Trade-offs] --> B(\"Reconciling Conflicting Fairness Criteria\");\\n    A --> C(\"Trade-off: Fairness vs. Performance\");\\n    A --> D(\"Trade-off: Fairness vs. Efficiency\");\\n    A --> E(\"Trade-off: Fairness vs. Computational Cost\");\\n    A --> F(\"Trade-off: Fairness vs. Usability\");\\n    A --> G(\"Scalability to Large LLMs\");\\n    A --> H(\"Limitations of Current Techniques (e.g., Fine-tuning)\");\\n    A --> I(\"Lack of Unified Evaluation Framework\");'></figure-link>\nMitigating bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents substantial challenges and trade-offs, significantly impacting the practical deployment of these models. A primary difficulty lies in reconciling multiple, often conflicting, fairness criteria simultaneously [1]. Optimizing for one definition of fairness, such as demographic parity, may inadvertently lead to a decrease in fairness according to another metric, like equalized odds [1]. This inherent tension necessitates careful consideration and prioritization based on the specific application context and ethical goals.\n\nFurthermore, a consistent challenge highlighted across the literature is the trade-off between achieving fairness and maintaining or enhancing model performance, efficiency, and computational cost [1,3,4]. Debiasing techniques, while crucial for ethical deployment, can sometimes lead to a degradation in the model's overall accuracy or its ability to understand and generate language effectively [3]. Model-centric mitigation methods, such as fine-tuning, are often resource-intensive and carry the risk of introducing new biases stemming from the characteristics of the additional training data [4]. This necessitates vigilance and sometimes a compromise to ensure that bias-mitigation efforts do not unduly harm the model's core functionalities [4].\n\nEmpirical evidence underscores these challenges. Studies comparing LLMs with traditional ML models in tasks like tabular classification demonstrate that even with mitigation techniques such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, LLMs often exhibit a larger fairness metric gap between different subgroups than their traditional counterparts [5,8]. For instance, quantitative results show that the fairness metrics of LLMs, even after mitigation, do not reach the levels achieved by traditional ML models [5,8]. This suggests a fundamental difficulty in fully removing the deep-seated biases inherited from the pretraining phase through downstream mitigation strategies alone [5,8]. The continued existence of a significant fairness gap even post-mitigation highlights the limitations of current approaches and supports the claim that achieving comparable fairness to traditional models with LLMs remains challenging [8].\n\nThe scalability of mitigation techniques is another significant concern, particularly as LLMs and their training datasets continue to grow in size [1]. Methods that are effective on smaller models or datasets may become computationally prohibitive or logistically complex when applied to large-scale models [1,4]. Achieving the necessary balance between bias reduction and performance requires iterative processes involving trial and error, continuous monitoring, and fine-tuning [3].\n\nThe critique of existing work further illuminates these challenges. The lack of a unified framework for evaluating and comparing different mitigation strategies hinders the systematic assessment of their effectiveness and associated trade-offs [1]. Many current mitigation techniques are still in nascent stages of development, and their long-term impact and scalability require further rigorous investigation [1]. The difficulty in effectively addressing biases ingrained during pre-training, as shown in studies on tabular data prediction [5,8], indicates that current fine-tuning and in-context learning approaches have inherent limitations. These limitations, coupled with the resource intensity and potential for introducing new biases [4], highlight critical gaps in our understanding and practice of LLM bias mitigation. Addressing these challenges necessitates continued research into more robust, scalable, and less resource-intensive mitigation techniques that can effectively tackle deeply embedded biases while managing the complex trade-offs with performance and other desirable model attributes.\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\n<figure-link title='LLM Fairness Case Studies' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[LLM Fairness Case Studies] --> B(\"Tabular Data Prediction\");\\n    B --> C(\"High-Stakes Applications<br>(Loan, Hiring, Justice)\");\\n    A --> D(\"Medical Decision-Making (Potential Bias)\");\\n    A --> E(\"Content Generation (e.g., Job Descriptions)\");'></figure-link>\nHaving explored general mitigation strategies, this chapter transitions to examining the manifestation and addressing of bias and fairness within specific Large Language Model (LLM) applications through the lens of case studies. These case studies provide concrete examples of how the theoretical principles of bias and fairness translate into practical challenges and observations in real-world scenarios. It is important to acknowledge that the scope of these case studies within this discussion is limited to the applications highlighted in the provided papers, underscoring the need for broader research across a wider array of LLM applications in the future. The subsequent sub-sections analyze the unique fairness challenges presented by specific applications, compare the fairness performance of LLMs to traditional methods within those domains, and discuss the implications of deploying LLMs in sensitive areas. We will present illustrative examples of how bias manifests in these applications and synthesize the lessons learned from these cases, evaluating their generalizability to broader LLM applications [5].\n\nOne prominent case study discussed is the application of LLMs to tabular data prediction tasks [5,8]. This domain presents unique challenges due to the structured nature of the data, contrasting with the text-based training of LLMs. The analysis will delve into how biases inherited from text corpora impact predictions on tabular data, particularly in high-stakes applications [8].\n\nA critical aspect of these case studies is the comparison of LLM fairness with that of traditional machine learning models [5,8]. Empirical observations and experimental results extracted from the relevant papers will be analyzed to understand how quantitative data, such as the fairness metric gap between subgroups [8], supports or challenges claims regarding bias sources, evaluation effectiveness, and mitigation performance in these specific applications. For example, the finding that LLMs exhibit a larger fairness gap than traditional models in tabular classification [5] provides empirical evidence supporting concerns about deploying LLMs in sensitive tabular domains without adequate fairness considerations.\n\nFurthermore, this section will integrate critiques of existing work, highlighting limitations, unanswered questions, practical difficulties, ethical dilemmas, or gaps that impact the current understanding or practice within these specific application areas. For instance, the observation of only moderate success with in-context learning and fine-tuning for fairness improvement in tabular prediction by LLMs [8] points to a significant gap in effective mitigation strategies for this domain. Another example concerns potential biases in medical decision-making when LLMs are involved [9].\n\nThe generalizability of the challenges and findings from these specific cases to broader LLM applications is a key consideration [5]. While each application has unique characteristics, the underlying mechanisms of bias formation and propagation in LLMs, such as the influence of training data, often share commonalities. For example, the issue of LLMs inheriting biases from their training data, as seen in tabular data applications [8], is a general concern applicable across diverse LLM uses, from content generation to medical diagnosis. Similarly, the challenges in effectively mitigating these biases, observed in the moderate success of current techniques in tabular prediction [8], highlight a broader need for the development of more robust and universally applicable fairness-enhancing methods for LLMs. Real-world examples, such as the amplification of stereotypes in job descriptions generated by AI [4], provide concrete illustrations of how bias manifests in specific applications and underscore the practical implications of these fairness challenges. The case studies discussed herein, including those related to bias mitigation efforts by major tech companies [3], offer valuable lessons on the complexities of achieving fairness in LLMs and the ongoing efforts within the field.\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nApplying Large Language Models (LLMs) to tabular data predictions presents unique and significant fairness challenges. Unlike traditional machine learning models specifically designed for structured data, LLMs are primarily trained on vast textual corpora. This inherent difference in training data and model architecture leads to LLMs inheriting social biases from their training data, which critically impacts their fairness when applied to tabular tasks [5,8]. \n<figure-link title='Tabular Data Applications in High-Stakes Domains' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[High-Stakes Tabular Applications] --> B(\"Loan Applications\");\\n    A --> C(\"Hiring Processes\");\\n    A --> D(\"Criminal Justice\");\\n    A --> E(\"Healthcare\");'></figure-link>\nTabular data is widely used in high-stakes applications such as loan applications, hiring processes, and criminal justice, where fair outcomes are paramount [8]. The potential for LLMs to perpetuate and even amplify existing societal biases in these domains is a significant ethical concern [5,8].\n\nResearch investigating the fairness of LLMs for tabular prediction tasks has demonstrated that these models exhibit a larger fairness gap compared to traditional models [8]. This finding is particularly concerning given the increasing interest in leveraging the capabilities of LLMs for various data analysis tasks. The study by [8] reveals that LLM classifications are substantially influenced by social biases and stereotypes embedded in their training data when performing tabular data predictions, leading to consequential implications for fairness [5]. This highlights a fundamental challenge: LLMs are not natively designed for the structured nature of tabular data, and their pre-training on unstructured text imparts biases that manifest when applied to this new domain [8].\n\nEvaluation methods in this context often involve assessing the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" [8]. While techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning have been explored as potential solutions, their impact on improving fairness in tabular prediction tasks by LLMs has been observed to be only \"moderate\" [8]. This limited effectiveness of current mitigation strategies underscores a critical gap in the research landscape regarding how to effectively achieve fairness for LLMs operating within tabular domains [8].\n\nThe findings presented in [5,8] reveal a critical gap in both the understanding and the practical approaches for addressing fairness when applying LLMs to tabular data. This domain has historically been the purview of specialized ML models designed with tabular data structures in mind. The demonstration that biases inherent in LLMs pose a significant risk in high-stakes tabular applications highlights the need for dedicated research into fairness-aware methodologies tailored for LLMs in this specific context [5]. The current state of understanding is limited by the moderate success of existing mitigation techniques and the persistent larger fairness gap observed compared to traditional models [8]. This gap necessitates further investigation into the specific mechanisms by which LLMs process tabular data and inherit biases, as well as the development of more effective fairness-enhancing techniques for this application domain. The practical difficulty lies in adapting models designed for text to the nuances of structured data while simultaneously addressing the complex issue of embedded social biases.\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\n<figure-link title='Fairness Comparison: LLMs vs. Traditional ML (Tabular Data)' type='mermaid' content='graph LR\\n    A[Traditional ML Models<br>(Random Forest, NN)] --> B(\"Lower Fairness Gap\");\\n    C[Large Language Models (LLMs)] --> D(\"Larger Fairness Gap<br>(Even with Mitigation)\");\\n    B -- Preferred for Sensitive Tabular --> E[Fairness-Critical Applications];\\n    D -- Requires Further Research --> E;'></figure-link>\nAn empirical comparison of LLMs and traditional machine learning models, specifically Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks, in the context of tabular classification tasks reveals significant differences in fairness performance [5,8]. The results indicate that the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is consistently larger in LLMs compared to traditional models, even after the application of mitigation techniques to the LLMs [5,8]. This finding suggests that, despite their generalized capabilities, LLMs are currently less equitable than specialized traditional ML models for tabular data applications where fairness is a critical concern [5].\n\nThe larger fairness metric gap in LLMs, even post-mitigation, highlights a fundamental difference in how biases manifest and are addressed within these distinct model paradigms [8]. This discrepancy can be attributed to the inherent complexity of LLMs, particularly their pre-training on vast and potentially biased text corpora, which introduces challenges in bias mitigation not typically encountered in traditional models trained on structured tabular data [8].\n\nThe empirical evidence from the comparison underscores a critical limitation of LLMs in sensitive tabular data applications: their current inability to match the fairness performance of established, task-specific traditional models [5]. This observation directly challenges the notion of readily transitioning to LLMs for all tasks from a fairness perspective. While LLMs offer advantages in terms of generalization and versatility, their current performance in tabular fairness raises significant questions about their direct applicability in contexts demanding high levels of fairness and non-discrimination [5]. The findings suggest that for tasks involving sensitive tabular data, traditional ML models may remain the preferred choice due to their superior fairness performance [5]. The current state of research indicates that achieving comparable fairness levels in LLMs for tabular data requires further investigation into more effective mitigation strategies that can counteract the biases embedded during their large-scale pre-training [8]. This highlights a critical gap in current understanding and practice: effectively transferring or developing bias mitigation techniques suitable for the unique architectural and training characteristics of LLMs when applied to structured data problems.\n## 8. Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\n<figure-link title='Frameworks for Responsible LLMs' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Responsible LLMs] --> B[Fairness Standards];\\n    A --> C[Ethical Guidelines];\\n    A --> D[Governance Frameworks];'></figure-link>\nBeyond the technical solutions explored in preceding chapters, this chapter delves into the broader landscape of fairness standards, ethical guidelines, and governance frameworks crucial for the responsible development and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1,7]. The emerging efforts to establish formal standards for evaluating and reporting bias and fairness in LLMs are increasingly recognized as pivotal [1]. Such standards are essential for guiding responsible AI development and deployment, ensuring that LLMs do not perpetuate or amplify societal biases [3,7].\n\nThe need for formal standards and guidelines is underscored by the significant ethical concerns surrounding LLM bias, particularly when these models are employed in high-stakes decision-making processes [3]. These concerns extend to the potential for LLMs to reinforce harmful stereotypes, contribute to discrimination, and erode public trust in AI systems [3]. Establishing clear standards, therefore, is a critical step towards developing trustworthy LLM technology and mitigating the negative impact of stereotypes [3].\n\nHowever, the rapid evolution of LLM technology presents significant challenges in establishing and enforcing these standards [7]. The dynamic nature of LLMs requires adaptable and forward-looking standards that can keep pace with technological advancements. Furthermore, achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders on the definition and measurement of fair behavior remains a substantial hurdle [1]. This chapter will explore the current landscape of proposed standards and guidelines, the ethical frameworks and principles that underpin them, and the practical challenges encountered in their implementation and governance.\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nThe development of formal standards and guidelines for evaluating and reporting bias and fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as crucial [1]. Various initiatives are underway to establish frameworks for assessing and mitigating bias across the LLM lifecycle [1]. These efforts aim for widespread adoption across both industry and the research community [1]. Proposed roles for various stakeholders, including researchers, developers, policymakers, and end-users, are integral to shaping these standards [1]. \n<figure-link title='Regulatory Approaches to LLM Bias' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Regulatory Approaches] --> B(\"EU AI Act\");\\n    B --> C(\"Risk Categorization of AISs\");\\n    B --> D(\"Bias Mitigation Obligations<br>(High-Risk Systems)\");\\n    D --> E(\"Internal Guidelines\");\\n    D --> F(\"Active Monitoring/Tool Development\");'></figure-link>\nThe European Union's AI Act represents a significant regulatory step, categorizing Artificial Intelligence Systems (AISs) by risk level and imposing obligations such as bias mitigation for high-risk systems like recruitment tools [4]. The Act mandates \"appropriate\" measures to detect, prevent, and mitigate potential biases in training datasets for such systems [4], underscoring the need for internal guidelines within organizations for managing bias [4].\n\nDespite these efforts, significant gaps persist in current standardization initiatives [1,7]. Formal standards specifically addressing the unique challenges of bias and fairness in LLMs are still in nascent stages [1]. A primary challenge lies in standardizing evaluation methodologies and reporting mechanisms for fairness [1]. The rapidly evolving nature of LLMs further complicates the development and maintenance of relevant standards [1]. Achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders on the definition and measurement of fair behavior is another substantial hurdle [1]. The project outlined in [7] explicitly seeks to identify and analyze these gaps in current standardization efforts related to mitigating LLM bias, with a particular focus on the role international standards bodies should play [7]. While regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act highlight the necessity for bias mitigation [4], they often lack detailed technical standards or specific guidelines for achieving fairness within their framework, and the practical challenges of developing and adopting such standards remain largely unaddressed within the scope of some discussions [4]. These limitations and unanswered questions underscore the complexities inherent in establishing effective and widely adopted standards for bias and fairness in LLMs, impacting the current understanding and practice in this critical area.\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nThe pursuit of fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally underpinned by a range of ethical principles that guide their responsible development and deployment [1,6]. \n<figure-link title='Ethical Principles Guiding LLM Fairness' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Ethical Principles] --> B(\"Non-Discrimination\");\\n    A --> C(\"Accountability\");\\n    A --> D(\"Transparency\");\\n    A --> E(\"Privacy\");\\n    A --> F(\"Equity\");\\n    A --> G(\"Justice\");'></figure-link>\nThese principles often draw from broader ethical, philosophical, and social justice concepts, including non-discrimination, accountability, transparency, and privacy [1]. Ethical concerns surrounding LLM bias are significant due to the potential for these models to reinforce harmful stereotypes, contribute to discrimination, and disseminate misinformation, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare and politics [3]. The presence of bias erodes trust in AI systems, emphasizing the critical need for the development of trustworthy LLM technology [3]. Adhering to these ethical principles is paramount for the responsible implementation of LLMs [3]. The imperative of exploring fairness in LLMs is underscored by their widespread use in high-stakes applications involving tabular data, implying an ethical principle that AI systems in such contexts must be fair and not perpetuate societal biases [8]. Similarly, the concern about perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalized worldviews, and reinforcing political biases highlights the ethical considerations that drive research into LLM fairness [7].\n\nExisting work implicitly aligns with ethical principles such as fairness, transparency, and responsibility [6,8]. Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, further underscore these principles by imposing obligations regarding bias management, particularly when fundamental rights or non-discrimination are at stake [4]. This legal emphasis on preventing discrimination and negative impacts on fundamental rights explicitly references underlying ethical principles of fairness and non-discrimination in AI deployment [4]. Biases in LLMs can manifest as harms of allocation, leading to the unjust distribution of resources, or harms of representation, reinforcing detrimental stereotypes [4]. Aligning models with expected values through methods like reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics is mentioned as a mitigation strategy, implicitly referencing the ethical goal of producing desirable and fair outputs [4]. Furthermore, corporate action plans often involve aligning models with stated values, such as adherence to an ethical charter, and initiating bias management by choosing appropriate fairness criteria within a corporate framework [4].\n\nDespite the recognition of these ethical underpinnings, a significant challenge in the field lies in the translation of abstract ethical principles into concrete, actionable guidelines for LLM development and deployment [1]. While papers discuss the ethical concerns and impacts of bias, such as the reinforcement of stereotypes, discrimination, misinformation, and loss of trust, they often do not explicitly detail the underlying ethical frameworks or principles beyond a general call for responsible development and deployment [3]. The brief mentions of fundamental rights and aligning with values, while important, do not constitute a detailed exploration of specific ethical frameworks [4]. The implicit reliance on ethical principles without explicit articulation or discussion of specific frameworks relevant to LLMs and fairness represents a gap in the current literature [6]. The findings from studies investigating LLM fairness, particularly in sensitive domains like tabular data used in high-stakes decision-making, underscore the urgent need for more robust ethical frameworks and principles to guide responsible development and deployment [8]. Moreover, translating these abstract principles into concrete technical requirements and evaluation metrics for LLMs is complex [1]. Differing interpretations of ethical principles can lead to disagreements on the practical implementation of fairness, highlighting the difficulty in bridging the gap between ethical theory and technical practice [1].\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\n<figure-link title='Challenges and Approaches in Implementation/Governance' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Implementation/Governance Challenges] --> B(\"Lack of Clear Regulatory Frameworks\");\\n    A --> C(\"Complexity of LLM Systems\");\\n    A --> D(\"Diverse Applications/Contexts\");\\n    A --> E(\"Ongoing Monitoring Required\");\\n    A --> F(\"Persistence of Bias Post-Mitigation\");\\n    G[Implementation/Governance Approaches] --> H(\"Responsible AI Committees\");\\n    G --> I(\"Transparency Mechanisms\");\\n    G --> J(\"Accountability Frameworks\");\\n    G --> K(\"Tailored Actions (Case-by-Case)\");\\n    G --> L(\"Collaboration (Stakeholders)\");'></figure-link>\nImplementing fairness standards and ensuring effective governance in the real-world deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant practical challenges [1]. A primary difficulty lies in the lack of clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks specifically tailored to address the nuances of LLM fairness and bias [1]. The complexity of LLM systems, coupled with their diverse applications and contexts, makes it difficult to uniformly enforce fairness standards across different use cases [1]. Furthermore, ensuring fairness requires ongoing monitoring and evaluation of LLM behavior in deployment, which is a continuous and demanding process [1]. Even after mitigation efforts, the persistence of bias, particularly in high-stakes applications like tabular data prediction, highlights the limitations of current techniques and the challenges in achieving true fairness in practice [8].\n\nThe role of governance frameworks, policies, and regulations is crucial in promoting fairness and accountability [6,7]. Robust governance mechanisms are necessary to address biases effectively [6]. This involves creating transparent guidelines for data collection to actively identify and minimize biases in training data [6]. Responsible AI deployment, safeguarded by appropriate governance, is essential to mitigate bias [6]. The AI Act's requirements for bias mitigation in high-risk systems underscore the necessity of effective governance, including establishing guidelines, appointing responsible personnel, and implementing active monitoring and tool development [4]. Corporate action plans involving the selection of fairness criteria, identification of biases, benchmarking of different LLMs, and optimization of prompts represent a structured approach to managing bias [4]. Testing and adjusting models according to specific use cases are also considered essential [4].\n\nVarious approaches and strategies are being explored to address implementation and governance challenges [6]. Establishing responsible AI committees, implementing transparency mechanisms, and developing accountability frameworks are suggested practical strategies [1]. Organizations must prioritize mitigating biases through data curation, model fine-tuning, and logical modeling [3]. Appropriate governance structures, including establishing guidelines, appointing ethics officers, training employees, and implementing monitoring and technical tools, are considered vital [4]. The involvement of diverse development teams is also deemed essential for managing bias [4]. Actions must be tailored on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific use case, deployment context, and involved parties [4]. Effective governance requires collaboration between researchers, developers, policymakers, and civil society [1].\n\nHowever, current research highlights limitations and gaps in addressing these challenges. While some papers emphasize the need for governance, they often provide limited practical guidance on specific implementation strategies and concrete examples of governance structures [3,4,6]. Existing governance structures and regulatory frameworks are frequently ill-equipped to handle the unique challenges posed by LLMs, and ensuring compliance in complex, rapidly evolving systems requires ongoing effort and adaptation [1]. The difficulty in implementing fair LLMs in practice, as evidenced by the persistence of bias despite mitigation efforts, underscores the need for more effective implementation and governance strategies in real-world applications [8]. Practical strategies for ensuring compliance with fairness principles across diverse deployment contexts are still under development [1].\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\n<figure-link title='Key Challenges in LLM Bias and Fairness' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Comprehensive Challenges] --> B(\"Inherent Biases (Pre-training Data)\");\\n    A --> C(\"Bias Propagation\");\\n    A --> D(\"Evaluation Limitations (Metrics, Benchmarks)\");\\n    A --> E(\"Mitigation Limitations (Effectiveness, Trade-offs)\");\\n    A --> F(\"Ethical/Governance Complexities\");\\n    A --> G(\"Scalability\");\\n    A --> H(\"Dynamic Nature\");'></figure-link>\nDrawing together the insights from the preceding discussions, this section synthesizes the major challenges in addressing bias and fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) and outlines promising avenues for future research. A pervasive challenge is the inherent nature of social biases within LLMs, largely inherited from their massive pre-training corpora [5,8]. These biases are deeply rooted and not solely dependent on downstream task datasets, making them difficult to fully mitigate with techniques applied later in the LLM lifecycle, such as in-context learning or fine-tuning [5,8]. Furthermore, the propagation of biases from training data and human evaluation remains a significant hurdle [3].\n\nCategorizing these challenges based on the LLM lifecycle and related processes reveals distinct areas of difficulty. In the pre-training phase, the primary challenge lies in the biased nature of the data itself, leading to the absorption and perpetuation of societal prejudices [5,8]. Evaluation processes face the challenge of developing comprehensive bias assessments, as existing methods often focus on single bias types and utilize inconsistent metrics [2]. The suitability of benchmarks is also a key issue due to potential biases within test datasets [4]. Mitigation efforts encounter challenges in balancing bias reduction with maintaining or improving model performance, as training-based methods can be resource-intensive and potentially introduce new biases [3,4]. The limited effectiveness of current downstream techniques in closing the fairness gap further underscores the difficulty in this area [5,8]. From a broader ethical and governance perspective, the complexity of societal biases and the difficulty in aligning technical metrics with nuanced values present significant challenges [5,9]. Furthermore, achieving fairness in LLMs is a multifaceted challenge with many open questions [1]. A critical challenge across all stages is the scalability of fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs and datasets [1,6]. The dynamic nature of both LLMs and societal biases also poses a continuous challenge [1].\n\n\n<figure-link title='Future Research Directions for LLM Fairness' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Future Research Directions] --> B(\"Improved Pre-training Methodologies\");\\n    A --> C(\"Fairness-Aware Model Architectures\");\\n    A --> D(\"Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics/Benchmarks\");\\n    A --> E(\"Scalable Mitigation Strategies\");\\n    A --> F(\"Novel Fairness-Aware Algorithms\");\\n    A --> G(\"Integrating Logic\");\\n    A --> H(\"Interdisciplinary Approaches\");\\n    A --> I(\"Collaborative AI-Human Decision-Making\");'></figure-link>\nBased on these identified challenges, several promising future research directions emerge, framed as potential solutions. To address the challenge of inherent biases from pre-training, future research should focus on developing more effective pre-training methodologies and novel model architectures designed to be fairness-aware from inception [8]. This could involve exploring alternative pre-training objectives or data curation techniques that go beyond simple filtering. Addressing the limitations in current evaluation practices, future research should prioritize developing more comprehensive and nuanced definitions and metrics for fairness, particularly for complex generative models and compositional biases [1,2]. This includes creating robust and standardized evaluation benchmarks that cover a wider range of biases and applications, potentially using methods from formal verification and linguistics [1,2]. To overcome the limitations of current mitigation techniques, future work should focus on developing scalable and effective mitigation strategies that can be applied during both pre-training and fine-tuning [1]. This includes exploring novel fairness-aware training algorithms that can effectively mitigate bias without compromising performance [1]. Techniques like integrating logic into LLMs to promote inherent neutrality also warrant further exploration [3]. The need for continuous monitoring and adjustment in debiasing efforts suggests future work in developing more adaptive and robust mitigation techniques [3]. To tackle the scalability challenge, developing efficient and scalable mitigation techniques and evaluation methods is paramount [1].\n\nA crucial future research direction, necessary to move beyond purely technical solutions and address the complex socio-technical nature of bias and fairness in LLMs, is the embrace of interdisciplinary approaches [1,6,7,9]. Collaboration with social scientists, ethicists, policymakers, and legal scholars is essential to inform technical solutions, understand the causal mechanisms of bias, align technical definitions of fairness with societal values, and consider the societal implications of LLM bias and the role of policy and regulation [1]. For example, exploring causal inference methods in conjunction with social science theories could provide deeper insights into how biases manifest in LLMs and inform more targeted interventions [1]. Research on context-specific implementation of AI, ensuring it complements human cognitive processes, is also crucial, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical decision-making, necessitating collaboration with domain experts [9].\n\nWhile pursuing these future directions, it is crucial to maintain a critical perspective and consider potential risks or trade-offs. Developing novel pre-training techniques could be computationally expensive and may introduce unintended new biases. Similarly, while focusing on compositional fairness metrics is important, developing them comprehensively is challenging and aligning them across different domains is complex. Mitigation techniques often involve trade-offs between bias reduction and other desirable properties like model performance, efficiency, and generality [1,3,5]. For instance, highly specialized debiasing for specific tasks might compromise the generality of LLMs. Furthermore, increased regulation and standardization, while necessary, could stifle innovation if not carefully designed [7]. The immaturity of the field of LLM bias management itself means that vigilance and compromise are needed as research progresses [4]. Ultimately, ensuring fairness throughout the entire LLM lifecycle, from data collection to deployment and ongoing monitoring, remains an important area for future investigation [1].\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nThis survey has critically examined the pervasive issue of bias and fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs), a challenge central to their responsible development and deployment [7,10]. Our analysis has revealed that biases are deeply embedded within LLMs, primarily inherited from their vast and often unfiltered pre-training data [5,8]. This inherent bias significantly impacts their performance in various applications, including sensitive areas like tabular data predictions and clinical settings, where reliability and fairness are paramount [8,9]. The prevalence of biases, such as negative stereotypes, the erasure of marginalized perspectives, and the reinforcement of political biases, underscores the critical need to address these issues [7].\n\nWhile there has been notable progress in understanding the sources of bias, developing evaluation methodologies, and exploring mitigation strategies, significant challenges persist [1,4]. Existing evaluation benchmarks, while helpful, face limitations, and their suitability can be compromised by potential dataset biases [2,4]. Current mitigation techniques, including in-context learning and fine-tuning, have shown limited success in fully addressing the deeply rooted biases, with the fairness gap often remaining larger compared to traditional machine learning models [5,8]. Techniques without additional training, such as prompt engineering, offer simpler alternatives but require careful implementation to avoid negative impacts on performance [4].\n\nThis survey's structured analysis highlights significant gaps in both the fundamental understanding and effective mitigation of LLM bias. The field of bias management in LLMs remains complex and evolving, with evaluation and mitigation methods not yet fully mature [4]. The inherent nature of bias from the pre-training corpus, as demonstrated in tabular classification tasks, demands a fundamental rethinking of LLM fairness and a focus on addressing the root causes during the pre-training phase [5,8]. Cognitive biases in LLMs also pose a critical challenge, necessitating research into collaborative AI-human decision-making strategies and context-specific implementation to ensure AI complements human cognition [9].\n\nEnsuring fairness and accountability in LLMs is crucial for their widespread adoption and societal trust [3,4]. The current state of research, while showing promising avenues, clearly indicates the need for more robust, scalable, and comprehensive approaches to achieve truly fair and unbiased LLMs [1].\n\n\n<figure-link title='Call to Action for LLM Fairness' type='mermaid' content='graph TD\\n    A[Call to Action] --> B(\"Sustained Research\");\\n    B --> C(\"Novel Evaluation/Mitigation\");\\n    B --> D(\"AI-Human Collaboration\");\\n    A --> E(\"Interdisciplinary Collaboration\");\\n    A --> F(\"Ethical Vigilance\");\\n    F --> G(\"Responsible Development\");\\n    F --> H(\"Trustworthy AI\");\\n    A --> I(\"Policy/Regulation\");\\n    I --> J(\"Fairness Standards\");\\n    A --> K(\"Developer Actions\");\\n    K --> L(\"Curate Data\");\\n    K --> M(\"Governance\");\\n    K --> N(\"Monitoring/Auditing\");\\n    A --> O(\"User Engagement\");\\n    O --> P(\"Critical Use\");\\n    O --> Q(\"Advocacy/Transparency\");'></figure-link>\nTherefore, this survey issues a strong call to action for sustained research, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical vigilance to ensure the responsible development and deployment of trustworthy AI [1,6,7,8,9].\n\nFor researchers, future directions should focus on developing more sophisticated and comprehensive bias evaluation benchmarks that account for the multi-faceted nature of bias [2]. Research is also needed to explore novel debiasing strategies that go beyond current fine-tuning and in-context learning methods, potentially targeting the pre-training phase or incorporating fairness considerations into model architectures themselves [5,8]. Furthermore, investigating collaborative AI-human decision-making models to mitigate cognitive biases in sensitive applications represents a vital research avenue [9].\n\nDevelopers must prioritize ethical AI development principles, curating inclusive training datasets, implementing robust governance frameworks, and establishing continuous monitoring and auditing processes for LLM outputs [3,6]. Experimentation and prototyping are crucial in companies to identify effective organizational strategies for bias management [4].\n\nPolicymakers should actively engage with international standards bodies to develop and implement effective fairness standards for LLMs, addressing existing gaps and fostering a regulatory environment that promotes responsible AI development [4,7]. Establishing clearer guidelines and regulatory frameworks is essential for navigating the ethical complexities of LLM deployment [1,4].\n\nUsers must engage critically with LLMs, understanding their potential biases and advocating for transparency and fairness [6,9]. Promoting transparency in how LLMs are developed and deployed is essential for building public trust and ensuring accountability [6].\n\nAchieving a fair and unbiased future with LLMs requires a collective and multi-stakeholder effort [1,7]. By committing to sustained research, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, adhering to ethical principles, and maintaining vigilant oversight, we can navigate the complexities of LLM bias and unlock their transformative potential responsibly [6]. The crucial nature of understanding and mitigating bias to ensure the trustworthy development of LLMs cannot be overstated [8].", "ref_str": "## References\n[1] Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey https://github.com/i-gallegos/Fair-LLM-Benchmark\n\n[2] CEB: Compositional Evaluation Benchmark for Fairness in Large Language Models https://openreview.net/forum?id=IUmj2dw5se\n\n[3] Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) https://www.datacamp.com/blog/understanding-and-mitigating-bias-in-large-language-models-llms\n\n[4] How to avoid replicating bias and human error in LLMs https://hellofuture.orange.com/en/how-to-avoid-replicating-bias-and-human-error-in-llms/\n\n[5] Confronting LLMs with Traditional ML: Rethinking the Fairness of Large Language Models in Tabular Classifications https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.198/\n\n[6] Navigating The Biases In LLM Generative AI: A Guide To Responsible Implementation https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2023/09/06/navigating-the-biases-in-llm-generative-ai-a-guide-to-responsible-implementation/\n\n[7] Fairness standards for large language models https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/fairness-standards-for-large-language-models/\n\n[8] Investigating the Fairness of Large Language Models for Predictions on Tabular Data https://openreview.net/forum?id=6jJFmwAlen&noteId=uWWHObGssr\n\n[9] Cognitive Bias in Large Language Models: Implications for Research and Practice https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIe2400961\n\n[10] Understanding Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models (LLMs) https://uniathena.com/understanding-bias-fairness-large-language-models-llms\n\n", "digests": [{"bibkey": "understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms, navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation, cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice", "content": "# 0.

The critical need for addressing bias and fairness is highlighted due to the increasing societal impact and widespread deployment of LLMs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. This survey aims to provide a guide to understanding and mitigating bias in LLM generative AI for responsible implementation ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Bard, are AI systems that model and process human language using deep learning techniques, requiring millions or billions of parameters trained on a large corpus of text data ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs and Natural Language Processing (NLP) work in tandem to achieve a high understanding of human language patterns and learn knowledge from large datasets ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs are increasingly significant in the AI world, fueling the generative AI revolution and finding widespread deployment in various applications such as content creation, sentiment analysis, customer service, language translation, chatbots, personalized marketing, and data analytics ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Despite their versatility, a unique challenge is the potential for LLM bias, which is deeply embedded in the data used for training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The concern around LLMs and biases is particularly relevant given their use in the decision-making process, raising ethical considerations ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Addressing bias and fairness is critical due to the increasing societal impact and widespread deployment of LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nThe use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT is increasing, particularly in clinical settings. Concerns about their susceptibility to cognitive biases persist. This growing use and the potential for bias highlight the critical need for addressing bias and fairness in these powerful models ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nPrudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases that can emerge during training and deployment ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nSeveral biases can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Machine bias**: refers to the biases present in the training data used to build LLMs, which absorb and perpetuate stereotypes and discriminations present in vast human-generated datasets, including biases related to race, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Availability bias**: stems from the LLM's exposure to large amounts of publicly available data, leading it to favor readily available content while neglecting less prevalent perspectives and information ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. This can create information bubbles and echo chambers, reinforcing existing biases and potentially leading to misinformation if biased content is more available than factual content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Confirmation bias**: a psychological tendency where individuals seek information that confirms existing beliefs. This can be demonstrated in the training data or the prompt itself, where the AI may selectively generate content that reinforces the user's viewpoints ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Selection bias**: emerges when training data is not representative of the entire population or target audience, leading the model to lack knowledge for generating unbiased content for underrepresented groups or perspectives ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. An example is training data primarily from Western countries leading to difficulties generating accurate and culturally relevant content for non-Western audiences ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Group attribution bias**: emerges when the AI attributes specific characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on the actions of a few individuals, perpetuating harmful generalizations and prejudices (e.g., associating negative attributes with specific ethnicities or genders) ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Contextual bias**: arises when the LLM struggles to understand or interpret the context of a conversation or prompt accurately, potentially leading to inappropriate or misleading responses ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Linguistic bias**: occurs when the LLM favors certain linguistic styles, vocabularies, or cultural references over others, resulting in content more relatable to certain language groups or cultures while alienating others ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Anchoring bias**: occurs when an AI model relies too heavily on the initial information it receives, potentially incorporating early biases from training data and perpetuating them in generated content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n- **Automation bias**: refers to the human tendency to blindly trust AI-generated outputs without critical evaluation, assuming they are infallible ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. This is concerning as it leads individuals to place unwarranted trust in AI systems, potentially propagating false or biased information ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper provides a useful list of biases, it lacks a formal taxonomy or detailed conceptual basis for each bias type. The descriptions are high-level, and there is no discussion of how these different biases might interact or overlap.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs stems from the training data, which may contain unrepresentative samples or biases, leading the model to inherit and learn these biases ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Examples of LLM bias include gender, racial, and cultural bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. For instance, LLMs can exhibit gender bias if training data predominantly associates certain professions with specific genders, reinforcing societal stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Racial bias can manifest as associating certain ethnic groups with stereotypes, and cultural bias can lead to overrepresentation of certain cultures to fit stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The two main origins of biases in LLMs are data sources and human evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nLarge language models are prone to cognitive biases ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice'].\nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nLLM generative AI learns from vast human-generated datasets ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLLMs are AI systems that model and process human language, typically using deep learning techniques and requiring large amounts of text data for training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. They utilize Transformer models, which are deep learning architectures that understand context through sequential data analysis ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The process involves tokenization, where input text is broken into smaller units (tokens) for processing ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The model then uses mathematical equations and a probabilistic approach to understand relationships between tokens and predict the next sequence of words during training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The training phase involves inputting massive datasets to enable the model to understand linguistic contexts, nuances, and styles and build a knowledge base to mimic human language ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Bias in LLMs is a unique challenge that arises because the models interpret the training data as factual, and if this data is ingrained with biases or misinformation, the LLM's outputs will reflect these biases ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nBiases can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. The training data is a significant source of bias, as models absorb biases present in the text they are trained on ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. How the prompt is written can also introduce confirmation bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias is entrenched in the data used to train LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. If training data contains unrepresentative samples or biases, the model will inherit and learn them ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The two main origins of biases in LLMs are data sources and human evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This means that biases present in the vast datasets used for training and potentially introduced through human annotation or evaluation processes can propagate into the LLM's knowledge base and subsequent outputs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nBiases are present in the training data used to build LLMs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Since models learn from vast human-generated datasets, they absorb biases present in the text, perpetuating stereotypes and discriminations related to race, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Availability bias stems from exposure to large amounts of publicly available data, favoring readily available content and potentially neglecting less prevalent perspectives ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Selection bias emerges when training data is not representative, leading to a lack of knowledge for generating unbiased content for underrepresented groups ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Anchoring bias can occur if the model relies too heavily on initial biased information in the training data ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights data bias as a major source but does not detail specific preprocessing techniques or their mechanisms for mitigating bias. There is no discussion of how different types of data bias (e.g., representational, historical) manifest and interact.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe training data used for LLMs is a primary source of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. If this data contains unrepresentative samples or existing societal biases, the model will learn and perpetuate them ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. For example, if the training data shows women predominantly in certain roles and men in others, the LLM will reflect these stereotypes in its outputs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nGroup attribution bias emerges during training when the AI attributes characteristics to a group based on limited examples ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Training on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities of different groups is suggested to avoid this ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions training on diverse datasets but does not delve into specific model architecture choices or training techniques that could either introduce or mitigate bias. There's no discussion of how algorithmic biases might arise during the learning process.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nContextual bias arises when the LLM struggles to understand the context of a prompt accurately, leading to inappropriate responses ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Linguistic bias can result in content more relatable to certain language groups, alienating others ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Automation bias is a deployment concern where users blindly trust AI outputs, potentially propagating false or biased information ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Fine-tuning the model and carefully curating prompts are suggested to address contextual bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper touches upon deployment biases like automation bias but lacks detailed mechanisms of how these biases manifest post-training. It also doesn't discuss the role of user interaction design or deployment platforms in mitigating or exacerbating these biases.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nOrganizations need to employ multiple methods and metrics for evaluation to ensure that different dimensions of bias are captured in LLM outputs before they are released to the wider community ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExamples of methods for detecting, estimating, or filtering biases in LLMs include human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or hybrid evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Metrics such as accuracy, sentiment, and fairness can provide feedback on the bias in LLM outputs and help to continuously improve them ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The Google Research team's \"Fairness Indicators\" tool uses metrics like false positives and false negatives to evaluate performance and identify hidden biases that might be masked by general metrics ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the need for multiple methods and metrics for evaluation, implying that a single approach is insufficient for capturing all dimensions of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. While mentioning examples like accuracy and fairness metrics, it doesn't delve into the mathematical formulations or specific challenges associated with defining and measuring complex societal biases with quantitative metrics.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper implies challenges in evaluation by stating the need for multiple methods and metrics to capture different dimensions of bias, suggesting that comprehensive evaluation is complex ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The difficulty in detecting biases that may be concealed by general metrics is also highlighted by the description of Google's Fairness Indicators ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper focuses on the *need* for multiple evaluation methods and metrics but does not explicitly detail the overarching challenges and limitations inherent in the evaluation process itself, such as the lack of standardized metrics or the difficulty of measuring subtle or intersecting biases.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nTo address biases, data scientists must curate inclusive and representative training datasets, implement robust governance mechanisms, and continuously monitor and audit the AI-generated outputs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Fine-tuning the model and carefully curating prompts can help address contextual bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Data scientists should also carefully curate initial information and continuously monitor outputs to prevent anchoring bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Ensuring the AI model remains linguistically neutral and adapts to various language styles and cultural nuances can mitigate linguistic bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. For automation bias, data scientists and users must exercise skepticism and independently verify generated content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nStrategies for mitigating LLM bias include data curation, model fine-tuning, and employing multiple methods and metrics for evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Logical reasoning integration is also presented as an approach ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nTo prevent errors in decision-making with LLMs, it is recommended that clinicians aim to critically engage with LLMs, for example, by refuting their hypotheses rather than looking for confirmation ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice']. Researchers should focus on identifying and evaluating collaborative strategies between AI and human decision-making ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice']. Research on context-specific implementation is important to ensure that AI complements, rather than replicates, human cognitive processes ['cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nCurating inclusive and representative training datasets is a crucial step to address biases ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. By creating transparent guidelines for data collection, data scientists can actively identify and minimize biases in the training data ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Training on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups is necessary to avoid group attribution bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Carefully curating the initial information provided to the model can prevent anchoring bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper emphasizes the importance of data curation but lacks specific techniques for achieving inclusivity and representativeness in large-scale datasets. It doesn't provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of these data-centric approaches.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCompanies need to be highly responsible for the type of data they input into models ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Ensuring that training data is curated from a diverse range of sources (different demographics, languages, cultures) helps balance representation and reduces the impact of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This also guides targeted model fine-tuning efforts ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nFine-tuning the model is suggested to better comprehend context and avoid generating contextually inappropriate or biased content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions fine-tuning but does not elaborate on specific model-centric mitigation techniques like adversarial training or reinforcement learning from human feedback. The mechanism by which fine-tuning addresses contextual bias is not detailed.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nAfter data curation, organizations can improve accuracy and reduce biases through model fine-tuning ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Transfer Learning is one approach, where a pre-trained model is further trained on a smaller, more specific dataset to fine-tune its output, for example, fine-tuning on legal documentation using a general text pre-trained model ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Bias Reduction Techniques should also be implemented, such as bias detection tools ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Counterfactual data augmentation, which involves altering training data to break stereotypical associations, can reduce gender, racial, or cultural biases ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. A study integrated logical reasoning into LLMs, resulting in a \"neutral language model\" where relationships between tokens are considered neutral without explicit logic, leading to less biased models without needing more data or additional algorithm training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This logic-aware approach helps avoid producing harmful stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The MIT CSAIL study on integrating logic into LLMs found the newly trained model was less biased without the need for more data and additional algorithm training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper presents several model fine-tuning approaches and highlights the potential of integrating logic, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of their effectiveness, computational costs, or trade-offs.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [cognitive_bias_in_large_language_models_implications_for_research_and_practice]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nContinuously monitoring and auditing the AI-generated outputs is a necessary step to address biases ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nAs Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in our daily lives, AI's concepts of bias and fairness, especially in large language models (LLMs), are becoming more critical ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. These tools, which power applications like chatbots, translation services, and content generation, can transform industries, but they also pose significant challenges ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAI systems can replicate human bias, which is amplified with the rise of large language models (LLMs) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Bias in AI systems can lead to incorrect decisions or discrimination ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. An example is job descriptions created by generative AI containing more stereotypes than those written by people, including GPT-4o ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These concerns are critical as LLMs become exponentially more popular and integrated into large-scale applications like search engines and office suites ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. This massive adoption emphasizes the need to understand and manage bias to ensure fair and accountable systems . According to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report, the number of scientific papers on fairness and bias has increased by 25% since 2022 ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nThe increasing scale and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread deployment in various applications, including conversational AI, content generation, and code assistance ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This growing influence necessitates a critical examination of potential biases embedded within these models, which can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Addressing bias and fairness in LLMs is crucial to ensure their responsible and equitable use in society ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of bias and fairness in LLMs, covering definitions, sources, evaluation methods, and mitigation strategies ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that a model might make regarding its predictions that unfairly favour one group and disadvantage another ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. Fairness in AI is about having the system treat all users equally and avoiding the perpetuation of societal inequities ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nThis section explores the fundamental concepts related to bias and fairness in the context of LLMs, laying the groundwork for understanding the various manifestations and challenges.\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that a model might make regarding its predictions that unfairly favour one group and disadvantage another ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. In Machine Learning, this Bias usually comes through the data used to develop models, the design of algorithms, or the interpretations of the outputs ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nA bias can be defined as a deviation from the norm in the field of AI ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Four broad families of norms and thus four types of bias have been identified: statistical bias (e.g., taking an average that simplifies a phenomenon), methodological bias (e.g., using an insufficiently accurate device or an LLM trained on outdated datasets), cognitive bias (e.g., making a subjective and irrational decision), and socio-historical bias (e.g., training an LLM on data from a single country and using it in others with different worldviews) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides a high-level typology of bias but lacks deeper conceptual bases or a detailed taxonomy beyond these four categories. It doesn't delve into the nuances of how these biases specifically manifest in LLM outputs or their intersectionality.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs can be defined as the systematic and unfair favoring of certain individuals or groups over others ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Different types of biases can manifest, including social biases reflected in training data, demographic biases related to sensitive attributes, representational biases where certain groups are underrepresented, and cognitive biases mirroring human cognitive shortcuts ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper suggests a taxonomy that categorizes bias based on its source and manifestation in LLM outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Defining and categorizing bias in LLMs remains challenging due to the complex nature of these models and the multifaceted aspects of societal bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is no single, universally accepted definition of bias in LLMs, leading to variations in how it is identified and measured ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nFairness in AI is about having the system treat all users equally and avoiding the perpetuation of societal inequities ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. In other words, models need to be designed with respect for diversity and deliver good results regardless of the user's background ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper does not provide specific fairness definitions or quantitative metrics.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nFairness in LLMs refers to the property of the model's outputs being equitable and non-discriminatory across different groups or individuals ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Various conceptualizations of fairness exist, often borrowed from algorithmic fairness in traditional machine learning, such as demographic parity, equalized odds, and individual fairness ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Quantitative metrics are used to measure these fairness definitions. For example, demographic parity aims for equal prediction outcomes across different groups: $$|P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1)| \\approx 0$$, where $\\hat{Y}=1$ is the positive prediction and $A$ represents a sensitive attribute ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Equalized odds requires that the model has equal true positive rates and false positive rates across different groups: $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=1)$$ and $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=0) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=0)$$ ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Applying traditional fairness metrics to the generative and open-ended nature of LLM outputs is challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Many metrics designed for classification tasks are not directly applicable to text generation or other complex LLM functionalities ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Furthermore, satisfying multiple fairness criteria simultaneously is often impossible, leading to trade-offs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLLMs are trained on massive datasets drawn from the internet, books, and other digital repositories ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. Such datasets often contain historical, cultural, and societal biases ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAn LM (Language Model) is a statistical model designed to represent natural language ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. LLMs are advanced versions trained on vast datasets using sophisticated architectures ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Their ability to understand and generate text coherently and contextually revolutionizes NLP applications, improving machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and human-machine interaction systems ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nThe development pipeline of Generative LLMs mainly consists of two blocks: a basic model for language encoding and a second model fine-tuned for specific instructions (e.g., open questions/answers) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. This second model can be further tailored to a desired task or aligned with stated values ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nLLMs are typically based on transformer architectures and trained on vast amounts of text data using self-supervised learning objectives like predicting the next token ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text stems from learning complex statistical relationships and patterns within the training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Bias can be introduced and amplified during various stages of the LLM lifecycle, primarily through the training data, which often reflects societal biases ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The immense scale of training data makes it difficult to curate and filter out all forms of bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The training process itself, including the optimization objectives and model architecture, can also inadvertently reinforce biases present in the data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias can creep into LLMs through several key areas ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI systems arises from the datasets used for training, architecture choices, and inappropriate usage ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. In LLMs, the huge scale of pre-training datasets, the adaptation process (alignment, specialization), bias mitigation choices, and the nature of the Prompt can cause harms of allocation (unjust resource distribution) or representation (reinforcement of stereotypes) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Harms of allocation produce immediate, easy-to-formalize effects, while harms of representation produce long-term, more difficult-to-formalize effects ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nBiases in LLMs can manifest as intrinsic bias (in internal representations) and extrinsic bias (in final decisions and predictions) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias propagation in LLMs occurs throughout their lifecycle, from data collection to deployment. The primary sources of bias include the vast and often uncurated training data, model architecture choices, training procedures, and how the models are fine-tuned and deployed in specific applications ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Bias can manifest in various ways, such as stereotypical associations in generated text, discriminatory outputs in downstream tasks, and differential performance across demographic groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe training data may overrepresent or underrepresent certain groups, thereby leading to skewed outputs ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. For instance, if a dataset consists of predominantly Western-centric texts, the model may end up generating responses that favour Western perspectives ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI systems arises from the datasets used to train the model ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. In LLMs, the huge scale of the pre-training datasets is a source of bias ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions data sets as a source of bias but does not provide concrete examples of how bias is introduced during data collection and preprocessing, nor does it offer detailed mechanisms or statistical observations.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias in the training data is a major source of bias in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Text data from the internet often contains societal stereotypes, historical biases, and prejudiced language ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For example, associations between certain professions and genders (e.g., \"nurse\" with female, \"engineer\" with male) are prevalent in large text corpora ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Inadequate data preprocessing techniques can fail to mitigate these biases and may even amplify them ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The sheer scale and diversity of internet data make it challenging to identify and remove all biased content effectively ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While the impact of data bias is widely acknowledged, developing effective and scalable methods for identifying and mitigating bias in massive, heterogeneous datasets remains an open challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI systems arises from architecture choices ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The adaptation process (aligning with human values, specializing) can also introduce bias ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Biases in LLMs can manifest within the model’s internal representations (intrinsic bias) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions architecture choices and the adaptation process as sources of bias but does not provide specific examples, detailed mechanisms, or empirical observations of bias introduction during model architecture design or training.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nWhile the transformer architecture itself is not inherently biased, certain aspects of the training process can contribute to bias propagation ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The objective functions used for training, such as next-token prediction, can incentivize the model to reproduce patterns and associations present in the biased data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The inductive biases introduced by the model architecture and optimization algorithms can also play a role in how biases are learned and manifested ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Understanding the precise mechanisms by which model architecture and training procedures contribute to bias is complex and requires further research ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Developing training techniques that are inherently more robust to data bias is a significant challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nInappropriate usage and the nature of the Prompt can cause harms of allocation or representation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Biases in LLMs can manifest in the final decisions it takes (extrinsic bias) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights inappropriate usage and prompt as sources of bias in deployment but lacks concrete examples, detailed mechanisms, or empirical observations of bias manifestation at this stage.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias can also be introduced or exacerbated during the post-training phase and deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Fine-tuning LLMs on smaller, task-specific datasets can introduce new biases or amplify existing ones if the fine-tuning data is not carefully curated ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The way LLMs are prompted and used in specific applications can also reveal or exploit biases within the model ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For example, biased prompts can elicit stereotypical responses from an LLM ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Ensuring fairness during the fine-tuning and deployment stages requires careful consideration of the specific application context and potential impact on different user groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Developing methods to monitor and mitigate bias in real-world LLM applications is an ongoing challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs can be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Intrinsic methods analyze relationships between words in internal representations or observe differences in assigned probabilities ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Extrinsic methods focus on model performance at specific tasks ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEvaluating bias and fairness in LLMs is a critical step in understanding their limitations and developing mitigation strategies ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This section discusses the methodologies and benchmarks used for this purpose.\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBenchmarks comprise a test dataset and NLP task-specific evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks measure the quality and effectiveness of models on specific tasks such as machine translation or text generation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. They allow comparing models based on objective and reproducible criteria ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Developing a benchmark requires collecting data, annotating it if necessary, defining the task, and establishing how to measure task performance (evaluation metrics) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper mentions comparing different LLMs using an existing benchmark or developing one ad hoc as part of a corporate action plan ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. This involves comparing the results of different models on the benchmark ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The test datasets used in benchmarks can bring their own biases, making the suitability of the benchmarks used a key issue when evaluating LLMs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nSeveral benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate specific types of bias in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Examples include:\n*   **BBQ (Bold Bias Dataset)**: Designed to measure social biases in question answering ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **CrowS-Pairs**: Evaluates stereotypical associations by comparing the model's probability of completing sentences with stereotypical vs. anti-stereotypical endings ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **StereoSet**: Measures gender, race, and religious biases by assessing whether a model associates words with certain social groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **WinoBias and WinoGender**: Focus on gender bias in coreference resolution ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nThese benchmarks often provide specific metrics to quantify the observed bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For instance, CrowS-Pairs calculates the Stereotypical Score, which is the percentage of times the model prefers the stereotypical sentence completion ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper compiles a list of publicly available bias evaluation datasets, including BBQ, BEC-Pro, Bias NLI, BOLD, BUG, CrowS-Pairs, Equity Evaluation Corpus, GAP, Grep-BiasIR, HolisticBias, HONEST, PANDA, RealToxicityPrompts, RedditBias, StereoSet, TrustGPT, UnQover, WinoBias, WinoBias+, WinoGender, and WinoQueer ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. While the paper lists these datasets, it primarily focuses on surveying existing work rather than presenting new experimental results comparing LLMs on these benchmarks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Current benchmark datasets often focus on specific types of biases and may not capture the full spectrum of biases that can manifest in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Benchmarks can also be limited by their reliance on human annotations, which can themselves be subjective and biased ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is a need for more comprehensive and dynamic benchmarks that can assess bias in diverse applications and across different demographic intersections ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nIntrinsic evaluation methods include analyzing relationships between words in the model’s internal representations or observing differences in how the model assigns probabilities to words ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Extrinsic evaluation methods focus on how the model performs at specific tasks ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. There are evaluation metrics specific to traditional NLP tasks aiming to measure the quality of LLMs on reference datasets or generated text ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks also include NLP task-specific evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper mentions defining how to measure that a task has been performed well on a body of data using evaluation metrics when developing a benchmark ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions using traditional NLP metrics but does not discuss specific fairness metrics or methodologies in detail.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBeyond benchmark datasets, various methodologies and metrics are employed to assess fairness in LLM outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These include:\n*   **Association Tests**: Measuring the strength of association between sensitive attributes and stereotypical concepts in the model's internal representations or outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Counterfactual Evaluation**: Assessing how changing a sensitive attribute in the input affects the model's output ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Performance Disparity Metrics**: Evaluating differences in model performance (e.g., accuracy, toxicity) across different demographic groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nThese methodologies often adapt metrics from traditional fairness literature, such as those based on statistical parity or equalized odds, to the specific context of LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper discusses how various metrics are applied in the context of existing research but does not present novel experimental results or comparative data using these metrics ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Applying fairness metrics designed for structured outputs to the generative and unstructured nature of LLM outputs is challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Defining what constitutes a \"fair\" output for a free-form text generation task is often subjective and context-dependent ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe test datasets used in the benchmarks can bring their own biases, making the suitability of the benchmarks used a key issue when evaluating LLMs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the challenge of biased benchmarks but does not discuss broader challenges like the lack of standardized metrics or the difficulty of measuring complex societal biases.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEvaluating bias and fairness in LLMs presents several significant challenges ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These include:\n*   **Lack of Standardized Metrics**: There is no universal set of metrics for evaluating fairness across all LLM applications and types of bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Difficulty in Measuring Complex Societal Biases**: Capturing nuanced and intersecting forms of societal bias through quantitative metrics is difficult ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Dynamic Nature of LLMs**: LLMs are constantly evolving, making it challenging to develop evaluation methods that remain relevant and effective over time ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Scalability**: Evaluating bias in large-scale LLMs and their applications requires significant computational resources and data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The field lacks comprehensive and standardized evaluation frameworks that can systematically assess bias and fairness across diverse LLM capabilities and applications ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Vigilance and compromise are sometimes necessary to ensure that bias-mitigation actions do not harm the model’s performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nAddressing bias and fairness in LLMs requires employing various mitigation strategies throughout their lifecycle ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These approaches can be broadly categorized as data-centric, model-centric, and post-processing techniques ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nData-centric mitigation strategies focus on addressing bias in the training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Techniques include:\n*   **Data Filtering**: Removing biased or undesirable content from the training corpus ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Data Augmentation**: Creating a more balanced and representative dataset by augmenting underrepresented groups or perspectives ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Data Reweighting**: Adjusting the weights of training examples to give more importance to underrepresented or sensitive groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nThese methods aim to reduce the exposure of the model to biased patterns during training ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper surveys existing research on data-centric mitigation but does not provide new experimental results or comparisons of different techniques ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Scaling data-centric mitigation to the massive datasets used for training LLMs is computationally expensive and challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. It is also difficult to identify and quantify all forms of bias in such large datasets ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAdditional training can entail supervised or semi-supervised fine-tuning or methods to align models with expected values (via reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These methods adjust models to reduce bias while maintaining performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: These methods are resource-intensive and can introduce new opinions or representations, leading to new biases consubstantial with the new data added for mitigation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nModel-centric mitigation strategies involve modifying the LLM or its training process to reduce bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Techniques include:\n*   **Fairness-aware Training Objectives**: Incorporating fairness constraints or regularization terms into the training objective ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Adversarial Training**: Training the model to be robust against adversarial attacks designed to expose bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Fine-tuning the model based on human preferences that penalize biased outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nThese methods aim to influence the model's internal representations or generation process to be less biased ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper surveys existing research on model-centric mitigation but does not provide new experimental results or comparisons of different techniques ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Model-centric methods can be complex to implement and may not always guarantee fairness across all types of bias and sensitive attributes ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There can also be trade-offs between fairness and model performance on other tasks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nIn the absence of additional training, techniques like post-generation self-diagnosis or prompt engineering can be used ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These techniques do not require additional training, are simpler, and require less expertise, making them easier to implement ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Post-generation self-diagnosis involves designing specific instructions to steer the model towards generating fairer and less biased responses, based on the model's ability to evaluate its own outputs after generation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Carefully formulated prompts can force the model to adopt varied perspectives and avoid stereotypes ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Prompt engineering with roleplay is also an effective method for revealing and mitigating certain biases ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The model uses predefined criteria (e.g., measures of bias, stereotyping, toxicity) to evaluate the fairness of the generated output ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. If the initial output is deemed biased, the model can adjust it in real-time or generate a new response considering the criteria ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The revised output is validated before being presented to the user ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Adjusting the temperature of the model, providing clear instructions, adding context, and providing examples are also techniques for prompt engineering ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nPost-processing techniques are applied after the LLM has generated an output to mitigate bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Techniques include:\n*   **Output Reranking**: Reranking generated outputs based on fairness criteria ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n*   **Bias Correction**: Modifying the generated text to remove or reduce biased language ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nThese methods act as a filter on the model's output but do not address the underlying bias in the model itself ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper surveys existing research on post-processing techniques but does not provide new experimental results or comparisons of different techniques ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Post-processing techniques can be limited in their ability to fully remove complex biases and may sometimes result in unnatural or nonsensical outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nVigilance and compromise are sometimes necessary to ensure that bias-mitigation actions do not harm the model’s performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Mitigation methods requiring additional training are resource-intensive ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper notes the resource intensity and potential for introducing new biases with training-based methods and the need to balance bias mitigation with performance, but it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of challenges or trade-offs across all mitigation strategies.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nMitigating bias in LLMs faces several overarching challenges and trade-offs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. A key challenge is the difficulty in achieving multiple fairness criteria simultaneously, as optimizing for one definition of fairness may negatively impact another ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The scalability of mitigation techniques to ever-larger LLMs and datasets is also a significant concern ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Furthermore, there can be trade-offs between fairness and model performance, efficiency, and computational cost ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper discusses these trade-offs conceptually but does not present empirical evidence quantifying these trade-offs for specific mitigation strategies ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: There is a lack of comprehensive studies systematically evaluating the effectiveness and trade-offs of different mitigation strategies across various types of bias and LLM applications ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 7.

Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAppropriate governance is necessary, including establishing guidelines for managing bias, appointing ethics officers and managers responsible for training employees, and implementing active monitoring and development of technical tools ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The European Union regulation on artificial intelligence (AI Act), in force since August 1, 2024, aims to regulate the development, marketing, and use of AISs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The Act classifies AISs by risk, from unacceptable to minimal ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. High-risk systems, such as recruitment or training assistance tools, require \"appropriate\" measures to detect, prevent, and mitigate possible biases in the datasets used to train models ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These obligations are particularly important if biases are likely to affect health, safety, fundamental rights, or lead to discrimination ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEnsuring fairness in LLMs requires the development and adoption of fairness standards, ethical guidelines, and appropriate governance structures ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe EU AI Act requires \"appropriate\" measures for high-risk systems to detect, prevent, and mitigate possible biases in training datasets ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Establishing guidelines for managing bias is part of appropriate governance within companies ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions the EU AI Act's requirements for bias mitigation in high-risk systems and the need for internal guidelines but does not detail formal standard development, specific standards, or the roles of various stakeholders.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nVarious initiatives and discussions are underway to develop standards and guidelines for responsible AI development, including fairness in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These often propose frameworks for assessing and mitigating bias throughout the LLM lifecycle ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper highlights the need for formal standard development and widespread adoption across the industry and research community ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. It suggests a role for various stakeholders, including researchers, developers, policymakers, and end-users, in shaping these standards ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Formal standards specifically tailored to the unique challenges of bias and fairness in LLMs are still in their early stages of development ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Gaps exist in standardizing evaluation methodologies and reporting mechanisms for fairness in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe EU AI Act's obligations regarding bias management are particularly important where biases are likely to affect fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Aligning models with expected values is a mitigation method ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper briefly touches on the importance of fundamental rights and aligning with values but does not explicitly detail underlying ethical frameworks or principles guiding fairness in AI and LLMs.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nThe discussion of fairness in LLMs is underpinned by broader ethical principles in AI, such as non-discrimination, accountability, transparency, and privacy ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Ethical frameworks provide a conceptual basis for understanding why fairness is important and guide the development of responsible LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper emphasizes the importance of aligning LLM development and deployment with ethical considerations ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Translating abstract ethical principles into concrete, actionable guidelines for LLM development and deployment is challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAppropriate governance, including establishing guidelines, appointing ethics officers, training employees, and implementing monitoring and technical tools, is vital ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. It is vital that the members of the teams involved in developing AISs are diverse ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Actions must be carried out on a case-by-case basis depending on the use case, deployment context, and people involved ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Within companies, the focus is currently on organization, developing prototypes, and experimenting ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper outlines the need for governance structures and diverse teams but lacks detailed discussion on the practical difficulties in implementing fairness standards and ensuring governance in real-world LLM deployment.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nImplementing fairness standards and ensuring effective governance in the development and deployment of LLMs face practical difficulties ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Challenges include the lack of clear regulatory frameworks, the complexity of LLM systems, and the difficulty in monitoring and enforcing fairness in real-world applications ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].

Developing fair and accountable LLMs will undoubtedly help with their large-scale adoption ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nThis survey highlights the critical importance of addressing bias and fairness in Large Language Models ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The prevalence of biases in training data and their propagation through the model lifecycle pose significant risks for discriminatory outcomes ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. While progress has been made in developing evaluation methodologies and mitigation strategies, significant challenges remain ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Future research needs to focus on developing more robust, scalable, and comprehensive approaches to ensure the fair and equitable development and deployment of LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. A collaborative effort involving researchers, developers, policymakers, and the public is essential to navigate the ethical complexities and realize the full potential of LLMs responsibly ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']."}, {"bibkey": "confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications, ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models, fairness_standards_for_large_language_models", "content": "# 0. Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nLarge language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for tasks beyond traditional NLP, including classification tasks on tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. However, LLMs are known to carry social biases inherited from their vast training data, which raises significant concerns when deploying them in high-stakes applications using tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This paper investigates the extent to which LLMs' classifications for tabular data are influenced by social biases and the resulting implications for fairness, particularly compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nLarge language models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems used for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation. Their recent commercialisation has brought benefits but also raises concerns about their potential to exacerbate harmful biases, including perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. Addressing bias and fairness is critically needed due to the increasing societal impact and widespread deployment of LLMs across various applications ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This project explores the role fairness standards can play in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, concerns regarding the potential negative societal impacts of LLM-generated content have also arisen ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly focuses on social biases present in LLMs, particularly those that reflect societal stereotypes and inequalities, as these are shown to influence tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the presence of \"harmful social biases\" in LLMs but does not provide a formal typology or detailed conceptual bases for different types of biases, focusing instead on their practical impact on fairness metrics in a specific application context ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper mentions harmful biases, such as perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases, that can be exacerbated by LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While specific typologies are not detailed, the paper highlights the manifestation of bias in terms of social stereotypes and political viewpoints ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper proposes a compositional taxonomy to characterize bias in LLMs ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. This taxonomy uses three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe study utilizes fairness metrics to quantify the disparity in performance across different demographic subgroups when LLMs are used for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While specific mathematical formulations of metrics like demographic parity or equalized odds are mentioned in the outline, the paper primarily focuses on the *fairness metric gap* between subgroups as a measure of bias, without explicitly detailing the calculation for each metric used beyond implicitly referencing the common understanding of these fairness concepts in the ML fairness literature ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the inherent biases within LLMs by demonstrating that even with mitigation efforts like in-context learning and finetuning, the fairness metric gap between subgroups is still larger than that observed in traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that current fairness metrics, while useful for evaluation, highlight a fundamental challenge in achieving fairness with LLMs due to deep-seated biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper broadly understands fairness standards as a means to mitigate harmful biases from LLMs, implying a conceptual basis for fairness related to preventing negative societal impacts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper does not explicitly define specific fairness metrics or discuss their mathematical formulations.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper notes that existing bias evaluation efforts often employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The paper itself does not explicitly define different fairness metrics or their mathematical formulations, but highlights the issue of inconsistent metrics in current evaluation practices ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Existing bias evaluation efforts employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, making comparisons across datasets and LLMs difficult ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper assumes a basic understanding of LLMs and their ability to perform tasks like classification through prompting or finetuning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It emphasizes that the social biases observed in their tabular classifications are *inherent* to the LLMs themselves and inherited from their massive pretraining corpora, rather than solely originating from the downstream task datasets ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper defines LLMs as advanced AI systems designed for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It notes their commercialization and potential to exacerbate harmful biases, which suggests that bias can be propagated through their designed functions and deployment, but does not detail the fundamental mechanisms or architecture responsible for this propagation ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on the bias inherited during the pretraining phase of LLMs as the primary source of bias affecting downstream tasks like tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It suggests that the vast and potentially uncurated nature of the pretraining data is a major contributor to the observed social biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper states that LLMs have the potential to exacerbate harmful biases by perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. While it identifies the outcomes of bias, it does not detail the specific sources or mechanisms (e.g., data collection, model architecture, training process) through which these biases are introduced or propagated within the LLM lifecycle.\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights that social biases are inherited from the LLMs' pretraining corpus ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This implicitly points to issues in the data collection and preprocessing of the massive datasets used for pretraining, although the paper does not delve into the specifics of these processes for the LLMs used.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings imply that the scale and scope of pretraining data collection and preprocessing for LLMs pose significant challenges for preventing the entrenchment of social biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates that even after finetuning on specific downstream tasks, the inherent biases from the pretraining phase persist in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that current training processes may not fully mitigate the biases embedded during initial training on large, potentially biased corpora.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the ability of current training and finetuning methods to fully eliminate biases absorbed during pretraining ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper does not explicitly discuss post-training or deployment-specific biases in detail, focusing primarily on the biases inherited during pretraining and their manifestation in downstream tabular tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper mentions that LLMs in deployment have the potential to exacerbate harmful biases, indicating a post-training bias manifestation through their use in natural language processing tasks ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper does not provide specific examples, mechanisms, or data regarding post-training or deployment bias beyond the general statement of potential harm ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates fairness by comparing the performance of LLMs and traditional ML models on tabular classification tasks across different demographic subgroups ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The evaluation focuses on the \"fairness metric gap\" between subgroups, implicitly using established fairness metrics like demographic parity or equalized odds, though specific benchmark datasets designed solely for LLM fairness evaluation on tabular data are not introduced ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper aims to map how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias and consider the efficacy of current standardisation efforts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This implies a need for methodologies and benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of these standards in addressing bias, but the paper does not detail specific evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, or datasets.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThis section focuses on the evaluation of bias in LLMs through the development of a compositional benchmark ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The paper addresses the limitations of existing bias evaluation efforts, which often focus on specific bias types and use inconsistent metrics, hindering comparisons ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The proposed CEB is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation strategy by considering different dimensions of bias ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe study uses several real-world tabular datasets (e.g., Adult Income, COMPAS, Credit) for evaluating the fairness of LLMs and traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. These datasets are commonly used in fairness research for traditional ML, allowing for a direct comparison ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper presents experimental results showing the fairness metric gaps for LLMs and traditional models (Random Forest, shallow Neural Networks) on these datasets ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Across multiple datasets, LLMs consistently show larger fairness metric gaps compared to traditional ML models, indicating higher bias ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. For example, on the Adult Income dataset, the demographic parity gap for LLMs can be significantly higher than for Random Forest ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's use of traditional tabular datasets for LLM evaluation highlights the need for benchmarks specifically designed to capture the nuances of LLM behavior and potential biases in tabular tasks, as LLMs approach these tasks differently than traditional models (e.g., through text representations) ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper introduces CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark, which is curated by collecting a variety of existing datasets designed for LLM bias evaluation ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The design rationale is based on a compositional taxonomy that characterizes datasets across three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. This compositional approach aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of bias ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper presents experimental results demonstrating that bias levels vary across the dimensions defined in the compositional taxonomy ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. This variation provides insights into where bias exists in LLMs ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. Specific quantitative data on bias levels for different LLMs across various bias types, social groups, and tasks are provided in the paper's experimental section (e.g., Figure 2 shows average bias scores for different LLMs across dimensions; Table 3 and 4 detail bias scores for specific datasets and tasks) ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Existing bias evaluation datasets often focus on only a particular type of bias ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper employs fairness metrics that measure the difference in model performance or outcome distribution between different demographic subgroups ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While specific metrics are not explicitly named with their mathematical formulas in the abstract, the concept of \"fairness metric gap\" indicates the use of established fairness metrics from the ML literature, likely including variants of demographic parity or equalized odds ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The methodology involves comparing these gaps for LLMs and traditional models on the same tabular datasets ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The experiments consistently show larger fairness metric gaps for LLMs compared to traditional ML models across various datasets and subgroups ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This indicates that LLMs exhibit higher levels of bias in these tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings reveal a limitation in current LLM application to tabular data: despite using standard fairness metrics, LLMs demonstrate persistent and often larger fairness issues than traditional methods ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that while the metrics are applicable, the models themselves pose a greater challenge for fairness.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the issue of inconsistent evaluation metrics used in existing bias evaluation efforts ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. While it proposes a framework for organizing evaluation datasets, it does not introduce new fairness metrics but rather utilizes existing ones within its compositional framework ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The methodology involves evaluating LLMs on the collected and organized datasets according to the compositional taxonomy ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The paper calculates bias scores based on the performance of LLMs on these specific datasets, categorized by bias type, social group, and task ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper presents experimental results showing bias scores obtained using their evaluation methodology on various LLMs ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. These results compare the performance of different LLMs in terms of bias across the compositional dimensions ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. (e.g., Figure 2 and Tables 3 & 4 provide quantitative comparisons of bias scores across different models and dimensions) ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Existing bias evaluation efforts employ inconsistent evaluation metrics ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates that evaluating LLM fairness on tabular data presents challenges because LLMs process data differently (e.g., as text) compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Existing fairness evaluation methodologies and datasets designed for traditional ML may not fully capture or explain the sources and mechanisms of bias in LLMs, which are deeply rooted in their pretraining data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The study highlights the limitation that even when evaluating LLMs on standard tabular fairness benchmarks, the inherent biases from pretraining remain a significant factor, suggesting that downstream evaluation alone may not be sufficient to fully understand and address the bias problem ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project will consider the efficacy of, and gaps in, current standardisation efforts related to mitigating LLM bias ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This suggests that there are challenges and limitations in the current approaches to using standards for evaluating and addressing bias, but the paper does not elaborate on what these specific challenges or limitations are.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights a need to analyze how gaps in standardisation should be filled for societally beneficial outcomes ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This implies limitations in the current evaluation landscape that standards aim to address.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nA key challenge addressed by the paper is the difficulty in comparing bias evaluation results across different studies due to the focus on specific bias types and the use of inconsistent metrics ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The paper's compositional approach is an attempt to mitigate these limitations by providing a more structured and comprehensive evaluation framework ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. While the paper proposes a more structured benchmark, the inherent complexity of defining and measuring all forms of societal bias in LLMs remains a challenge. The paper demonstrates that bias is not uniform but varies across different dimensions, indicating the need for nuanced evaluation rather than a single metric ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Existing bias evaluation datasets often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores the effectiveness of in-context learning and finetuning as potential mitigation strategies for reducing bias in LLMs performing tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Additionally, it investigates the impact of label-flipping in-context examples ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project explores the role that fairness standards can play in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This indicates that standards are viewed as a strategy for bias mitigation, but the paper does not detail specific technical mitigation techniques (data-centric, model-centric, or post-processing).\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper states that their experimental results, showing varying levels of bias across different dimensions, provide guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. However, the paper itself does not propose or evaluate specific bias mitigation techniques.\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates the effect of manipulating in-context examples through label-flipping as a data-centric approach to influence LLM predictions and potentially reduce bias ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This technique involves providing examples with flipped labels to the LLM during inference.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The experiments show that label-flipping in-context examples can significantly reduce biases in LLM predictions for tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This finding supports the idea that LLMs are sensitive to the specific examples provided in the prompt, which can be leveraged for bias mitigation ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While effective, the paper doesn't delve into the scalability or generalizability of label-flipping across different datasets and LLM architectures ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates the impact of finetuning LLMs on downstream tabular tasks as a model-centric mitigation strategy ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the specific task and dataset.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The study finds that both in-context learning and finetuning have only a *moderate* effect on reducing the fairness metric gap in LLMs for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The fairness gap remains larger than that of traditional ML models even after these interventions ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The limited effectiveness of finetuning highlights the challenge of mitigating deep-seated biases inherited during the massive pretraining phase, suggesting that downstream finetuning alone may not be sufficient ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper does not explicitly discuss or evaluate post-processing techniques for bias mitigation in the context of LLMs for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates that even with mitigation strategies like in-context learning and finetuning, achieving fairness in LLMs for tabular classification remains challenging ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. A key trade-off observed is that the fairness metric gap in LLMs remains larger than in traditional ML models, implying a fundamental difficulty in fully addressing biases inherent from pretraining through downstream interventions alone ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The comparative results showing larger fairness gaps for LLMs post-mitigation compared to traditional ML models illustrate the challenges and trade-offs, indicating that improving fairness in LLMs might require more fundamental changes than current downstream techniques offer ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings critically assess the current state of LLM bias mitigation, showing that existing techniques have only a moderate impact on fairness in tabular classification and that the inherent biases are difficult to fully eliminate ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on the role of standards in mitigation and the gaps in current standardisation efforts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This suggests challenges in applying standards for effective mitigation and potential trade-offs associated with this approach, although specific challenges are not explicitly detailed.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The project will consider the efficacy of, and gaps in, current standardisation efforts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This implies that current standardisation approaches may have limitations in effectively mitigating all forms of bias or may face practical difficulties in implementation.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights that the varying levels of bias across different dimensions suggest that a one-size-fits-all mitigation strategy may not be effective and that specific methods tailored to different bias types, social groups, or tasks may be needed ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper provides a specific case study on the application of LLMs for classification tasks using tabular data, analyzing the fairness implications in this context ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates bias across different tasks, which can be interpreted as implicit case studies for how bias manifests in various applications ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The tasks included in the CEB cover a range of NLP applications (e.g., sentiment analysis, question answering, text generation), and the evaluation shows how bias presents differently depending on the task ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper specifically examines the fairness of LLMs when performing classification on tabular data, highlighting the significant impact of social biases inherited from their training data on these predictions ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This application is particularly relevant due to the widespread use of tabular data in high-stakes decision-making processes ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The unique challenge lies in how LLMs interpret and process tabular data, often by converting it to a text format, which can introduce or amplify biases present in their language understanding capabilities ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper demonstrates that despite the potential of LLMs for tabular tasks, their inherent biases pose a significant fairness risk, suggesting that their application in high-stakes tabular settings requires careful consideration and robust mitigation strategies ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nA central part of the paper is the direct comparison of the fairness of LLMs with traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks, on tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The experimental results consistently show that LLMs exhibit a larger fairness metric gap between different subgroups compared to traditional ML models on the same tabular datasets ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This finding suggests that LLMs, despite their advanced capabilities, are currently less fair than established traditional ML methods for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: This comparison provides a critical perspective on the direct replacement of traditional ML models with LLMs in tabular tasks without addressing the inherent fairness issues in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It highlights that the perceived benefits of LLMs do not automatically translate to improved fairness and, in fact, can exacerbate existing biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 8.

It seeks to map how standards are being used, consider their efficacy and gaps, and analyze how these gaps should be filled, focusing on the role of international standards bodies like ISO ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project investigates how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias and considers the efficacy of and gaps in current standardisation efforts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It will analyze how these gaps should be filled and focuses on the role international standards bodies should play ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This indicates the importance of formal standard development and usage, identifies gaps in the current landscape, and suggests a role for stakeholders, particularly international bodies, in development and adoption.\nCritique of Existing Work: The project's objective to analyze gaps in current standardisation efforts implies that existing standards or guidelines are insufficient or face practical difficulties in effectively mitigating LLM bias ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly refers to ethical principles by discussing the potential of LLMs to exacerbate harmful biases, perpetuate negative stereotypes, erase marginalised worldviews, and reinforce political biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. Mitigating these issues through fairness standards is aligned with ethical considerations around equity, non-discrimination, and representational justice.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper does not explicitly detail specific ethical frameworks or theoretical principles guiding fairness in AI beyond the general notion of preventing harmful societal impacts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project aims to understand how standards are being used for bias mitigation and consider the efficacy and gaps in these efforts, with a focus on the role of international standards bodies ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This suggests challenges in the practical implementation and governance of fairness standards for LLMs, particularly in a global context involving different stakeholders.\nCritique of Existing Work: The focus on analyzing how gaps in standardisation should be filled highlights challenges in the current approaches to governance and implementation of fairness standards, implying that existing mechanisms are not fully effective in ensuring societally beneficial outcomes ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nA major challenge highlighted by the paper is the deep-seated nature of social biases within LLMs, inherited from their pretraining corpora, which are not fully mitigated by downstream techniques like in-context learning or finetuning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This poses a significant challenge for deploying LLMs fairly in sensitive applications, particularly those involving tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper implies a need for future research into more effective pretraining or architectural approaches to address the root causes of bias in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It also suggests exploring how LLMs draw information for tabular tasks as a direction for better understanding and mitigating bias ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings suggest that existing research on LLM fairness may not fully appreciate the extent to which pretraining bias impacts downstream applications and the limitations of current mitigation techniques ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The scaling challenge is implicit in the difficulty of addressing bias in massive models and datasets.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project identifies the need to map how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias, consider the efficacy of and gaps in current standardisation efforts, and analyze how these gaps should be filled ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This highlights challenges in the current understanding and application of fairness standards for LLMs. Future research directions are implied in the project's objectives to identify gaps and propose how they should be filled, particularly focusing on the role of international standards bodies ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. Challenges related to the scalability of fairness efforts to larger models are not explicitly discussed.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the challenge of inconsistent evaluation metrics and the narrow focus of existing datasets as major limitations in the current field of LLM bias evaluation ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The compositional nature of bias, as revealed by their experiments, suggests that future research should focus on developing mitigation methods specifically tailored to different combinations of bias types, social groups, and tasks ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. While the paper provides a framework for evaluation, future work is needed in developing mitigation strategies guided by this granular understanding of bias ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The challenge of scaling fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs and datasets is implicitly addressed by the need for a comprehensive and structured evaluation benchmark like CEB, which can be applied consistently across different models and potentially expanded with more datasets covering diverse scenarios.\nCritique of Existing Work: Existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, limiting comprehensive understanding and comparison ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that LLMs inherit significant social biases from their training data, which substantially impacts their fairness in tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It highlights that current mitigation techniques (in-context learning and finetuning) have only a moderate effect, and the fairness gap remains larger than that of traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The study emphasizes that biases are inherent within LLMs from pretraining, underscoring the need to address bias at the source ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This work serves as a call to action to rethink the fairness of LLMs, particularly in sensitive applications like tabular classification, and to develop more effective strategies to combat their inherent biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the growing significance of LLMs and the arising concerns regarding their potential to exacerbate harmful biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It proposes that fairness standards can play a role in mitigating these biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project aims to map the current landscape of standard usage, evaluate its effectiveness, and identify ways to improve it, specifically considering the role of international standards bodies ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This serves as a call to action for further work in developing and implementing effective fairness standards for LLMs.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that as LLMs are increasingly deployed, evaluating their biases is crucial ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. Existing evaluation efforts have limitations in terms of scope and consistency ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The proposed CEB, based on a compositional taxonomy, offers a more comprehensive approach to evaluating bias across different dimensions ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. The experimental results from CEB reveal that bias levels vary significantly across these dimensions, providing valuable insights for developing targeted bias mitigation methods ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nLate 2022 and early 2023 saw breakthroughs in the commercialisation of large language models (LLMs), advanced AI systems designed for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. These systems bring about numerous benefits, but also have the potential to exacerbate harmful biases by perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. This project explores the role that fairness standards, broadly understood, can play in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It seeks to (1) map how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias; (2) consider the efficacy of, and gaps in, current standardisation efforts; and (3) analyse how these gaps should be filled for societally beneficial outcomes, with a particular focus on the role international standards bodies should play ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project will employ a range of qualitative methods and engage stakeholders from the public, private, and third sectors ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThis section does not contain information on the theoretical frameworks of bias and fairness beyond defining specific fairness metrics.\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on the influence of social biases and stereotypes in LLMs, particularly in the context of tabular data classification. It highlights that LLMs exhibit harmful social biases that reflect societal inequalities ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on social biases in LLMs, particularly as they manifest in tabular data prediction tasks. It highlights that these biases are inherited from the large pre-training corpora and influence predictions based on demographic information ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the lack of comprehensive understanding and mitigation strategies for the deep-seated social biases inherent in LLMs, especially when applied to structured data like tables, which are prevalent in high-stakes decisions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper defines and utilizes several fairness metrics, including Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Odds (EO), and Average Absolute Inequality (AAI).\nDemographic Parity (DP) is calculated as the absolute difference in positive prediction rates between the unprivileged and privileged groups: $$DP = |P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0) - P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1)|$$.\nEqualized Odds (EO) requires equal true positive rates and equal false positive rates across groups. This can be split into two conditions: $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=1) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=1)$$ (equality of opportunity) and $$P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=0, Y=0) = P(\\hat{Y}=1|A=1, Y=0)$$ (equal false positive rates). The paper uses the average absolute difference for both true positive and false positive rates across groups.\nAverage Absolute Inequality (AAI) measures the average absolute difference in the outcome for all pairs of groups.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the limitations of current LLMs in achieving fairness metrics comparable to traditional ML models, even with mitigation strategies like in-context learning and finetuning. The fairness metric gap between subgroups in LLMs is larger than in traditional models, suggesting current approaches are insufficient to fully address inherent biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper utilizes fairness metrics to evaluate the impact of social biases on LLM predictions for tabular data, specifically comparing the fairness metric gap between different subgroups. While the paper does not explicitly list mathematical formulations of these metrics in the abstract, it relies on quantitative fairness evaluation to demonstrate the bias present ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The study implicitly points to the limitations of current fairness evaluation methods in fully capturing the complex biases inherent in LLMs when applied to novel domains like tabular data prediction, as mitigation efforts like in-context learning and fine-tuning had only moderate effects and did not eliminate the fairness gap compared to traditional models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nLLMs are advanced AI systems designed for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on LLMs as models for tabular classification and investigates the sources of bias propagation, specifically emphasizing the role of the pretraining corpus. It highlights that LLMs draw upon information from their training data when making classifications ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper implicitly suggests that the scale and characteristics of the pretraining data are key to understanding how bias is inherited and propagated.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper states that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their pre-training corpus, which significantly impacts their fairness in tabular prediction tasks. This implies that the vast and potentially biased data used for pre-training is a primary source of bias propagation into the model's internal representations and subsequent predictions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nHarmful biases can be exacerbated by perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper primarily focuses on the bias inherited from the pretraining corpus as a significant source of bias in LLMs when applied to tabular data tasks. It suggests that biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves due to their pretraining ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper emphasizes that social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and are inherited from their pre-training corpus. This suggests that the initial training phase on massive datasets is a key stage where bias is introduced and embedded within the model's parameters.\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper states that social biases are inherited from the pre-training corpus ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This highlights the role of the initial data collection for pre-training as a source of bias.\nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights that social biases are \"inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pretraining corpus\" ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This points to the training process, particularly the pretraining phase on large, potentially biased datasets, as a primary mechanism of bias propagation.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings suggest that biases stemming from the pretraining process are a significant challenge, as they are not easily mitigated by downstream techniques like finetuning or in-context learning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper indicates that biases are inherent within the LLMs and inherited from their pre-training corpus ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This points to the training process as the mechanism through which these data biases are embedded into the model's architecture and parameters.\nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines in-context learning as a form of post-training intervention and finds that while it has a moderate effect on fairness, it does not eliminate the significant bias gap compared to traditional models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The moderate effect of in-context learning on fairness suggests that simply providing unbiased examples at inference time is not sufficient to counteract the strong, inherent biases in the LLM itself ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores the impact of in-context learning and fine-tuning as post-training techniques on bias mitigation. While these methods have a moderate effect, the persistent fairness gap compared to traditional models suggests that biases are not fully removed during these stages and can still manifest during deployment ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Label-flipping of in-context examples was shown to reduce biases, suggesting that the choice and framing of examples during deployment can influence the manifestation of bias ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings suggest that existing post-training techniques like standard in-context learning and fine-tuning are not fully effective in mitigating the inherent biases present in LLMs when applied to tabular data prediction, leaving a significant fairness gap compared to traditional models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates fairness using specific fairness metrics on tabular datasets adapted for LLM input.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper uses \"a series of experiments\" to investigate bias and fairness in LLMs for tabular tasks. It highlights the use of fairness metrics to evaluate the predictions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper uses tabular datasets for evaluation, converting them into a format suitable for LLMs. While not explicitly called \"benchmarks\" in the traditional sense of a standardized suite like CEB, these datasets serve as the basis for their fairness evaluation experiments ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper describes the experimental setup involving processing tabular data for LLM input, using in-context examples, and evaluating performance and fairness on these datasets.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper presents experimental results on the fairness metrics (DP, EO, AAI) for different LLMs and traditional ML models on these tabular tasks. The results show that LLMs exhibit larger fairness metric gaps between subgroups compared to traditional models like Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the current state where LLMs, despite their capabilities, struggle to achieve fairness levels comparable to traditional models on tabular data, highlighting a gap in evaluation methodologies that specifically assess fairness in LLMs applied to structured data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper conducts experiments using tabular data tasks to evaluate the fairness of LLMs ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While specific dataset names are not provided in the abstract, the focus is on the application of LLMs to this data type for fairness evaluation.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper states that LLMs inherit social biases that significantly impact their fairness in tabular prediction tasks and that the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's focus on tabular data highlights the need for benchmarks and evaluation methods specifically tailored to this application domain for assessing LLM fairness, suggesting a gap in current benchmarks which may be primarily focused on language-based tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper explicitly uses Demographic Parity (DP), Equalized Odds (EO), and Average Absolute Inequality (AAI) to quantify fairness ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. These metrics are calculated based on the predictions made by the LLMs and traditional models on the test sets, considering sensitive attributes within the tabular data.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: See Section 5.1.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper demonstrates that even using standard fairness metrics, LLMs show significant disparities compared to traditional models, suggesting that the issue of bias is deeply rooted and not easily captured or addressed by applying standard metrics alone without effective mitigation ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper employs fairness metrics to quantitatively assess the bias in LLM predictions on tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The methodology involves comparing the fairness metrics of LLMs to traditional models and evaluating the impact of mitigation techniques.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The experiments showed a larger fairness metric gap between different subgroups for LLMs compared to traditional ML models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings suggest that while standard fairness metrics can reveal bias in LLMs for tabular data, they may not fully capture the nuances of how these biases manifest in complex LLM outputs. Furthermore, the persistent gap even after mitigation suggests limitations in current evaluation methodologies or the need for more sensitive metrics ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the challenge that even with mitigation strategies, the fairness gap in LLMs remains larger than in traditional ML models, indicating a limitation in current evaluation approaches to fully capture and address the inherent biases in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The findings suggest that simply measuring fairness with existing metrics is insufficient; there is a need for evaluation methods that can better probe and understand the source and persistence of bias in LLMs, particularly when applied to non-traditional tasks like tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly points to the challenge of evaluating inherent biases in LLMs, which are deeply embedded from pre-training. The fact that standard in-context learning and fine-tuning did not eliminate the fairness gap suggests that current evaluation methods, while revealing the bias, might not be sufficient to fully understand or measure the extent of these inherent biases ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The study highlights the limitations of existing evaluation approaches in fully assessing the impact of inherent LLM biases, particularly when applied to novel tasks like tabular data prediction ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThis project explores the role that fairness standards, broadly understood, can play in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores in-context learning and finetuning as mitigation strategies for improving fairness in LLMs on tabular tasks.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores in-context learning and fine-tuning as potential bias mitigation strategies for LLMs used in tabular data tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. It also investigates the effect of label-flipping in-context examples ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper does not explicitly discuss data-centric mitigation during pretraining or data curation for the tabular datasets used, focusing more on post-training interventions.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nWhile not explicitly focused on data preprocessing of the *tabular* data, the paper's finding that label-flipping of in-context examples can reduce bias suggests a data-centric approach to mitigation within the in-context learning paradigm. By modifying the input examples, the model's output bias can be influenced ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: Label-flipping of in-context examples significantly reduced biases ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The success of label-flipping as a mitigation technique within the in-context learning framework highlights the potential of data-centric approaches, specifically manipulating the input examples provided to the LLM, to address biases ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates finetuning as a model-centric mitigation strategy.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: Experiments show that finetuning has a moderate effect on reducing bias, but the fairness gap between subgroups in LLMs remains larger than in traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The moderate effectiveness of finetuning suggests that addressing bias solely at the finetuning stage is not sufficient to overcome the deeply embedded biases from the pretraining phase ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates fine-tuning as a model-centric approach to bias mitigation. Fine-tuning involves further training the LLM on a potentially debiased or task-specific dataset to adapt its parameters and reduce bias ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: Fine-tuning had a moderate effect on reducing bias, but the fairness gap remained larger than that of traditional models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The limited success of fine-tuning in eliminating the fairness gap suggests that this model-centric approach alone may not be sufficient to overcome the deeply ingrained biases inherited from the pre-training phase ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines in-context learning as a form of post-processing or inference-time intervention. It also demonstrates that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: In-context learning shows a moderate effect on fairness. Label-flipping in-context examples significantly reduces bias metrics, further supporting the idea of inherent bias in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's finding that label-flipping in-context examples is effective highlights the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt-based interventions, while also underscoring the underlying bias that needs to be counteracted ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines in-context learning, which can be seen as a form of post-processing or deployment-time intervention, where the model's behavior is influenced by the provided examples without altering the core model parameters ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: In-context learning had a moderate effect on reducing bias ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The moderate effect of in-context learning suggests that while it can influence the model's output in a less biased direction, it doesn't fundamentally address the underlying biases within the model itself ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates a significant challenge in mitigating bias in LLMs: even with techniques like in-context learning and finetuning, the fairness metrics do not reach the levels of traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests a trade-off between using powerful, general-purpose LLMs for specific tasks and achieving comparable fairness to models specifically designed or trained for those tasks with fairness considerations. The paper highlights that the inherent biases from pretraining are difficult to fully remove with downstream mitigation strategies.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The quantitative results comparing fairness metrics of LLMs with and without mitigation to traditional ML models provide empirical evidence of these challenges and trade-offs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings challenge the assumption that standard mitigation techniques effectively address the deep-seated biases originating from LLM pretraining, particularly in applied contexts like tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates that even with mitigation techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning, a significant fairness metric gap persists between different subgroups when LLMs are used for tabular data prediction. This highlights the challenge of effectively mitigating the inherent biases present in LLMs, suggesting that current methods may not be sufficient to achieve parity with traditional models in terms of fairness ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. A trade-off between fairness and performance might also exist, though not explicitly detailed in the abstract.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The fairness gap between subgroups remained larger for LLMs even after applying mitigation strategies compared to traditional ML models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The study reveals the significant challenge in mitigating biases that are deeply ingrained during the pre-training of LLMs, indicating that current fine-tuning and in-context learning approaches have limitations in achieving fairness for tabular data tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on the application of LLMs to tabular classification tasks as a specific case study.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses on the specific application of using LLMs for predictions on tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper directly addresses the fairness implications of using LLMs for tabular data predictions. It shows that LLMs exhibit social biases when performing these tasks, inheriting them from their training data. The paper highlights that LLM classifications for tabular data are significantly influenced by social biases and stereotypes, with consequential implications for fairness ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings reveal a critical gap in understanding and addressing fairness when applying LLMs to tabular data, an area traditionally handled by specialized ML models. It demonstrates that the biases inherent in LLMs pose a significant risk in high-stakes tabular applications ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe core of the paper investigates the fairness-related risks of using LLMs for tabular data predictions. It shows that LLMs inherit social biases that significantly impact fairness in this context ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The study aims to understand the sources of information LLMs use for these predictions and the extent to which social biases influence them ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper identifies the significant challenge of applying LLMs to tabular data due to the inherent biases carried over from pre-training, highlighting a gap in understanding and addressing fairness risks in this specific application domain ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nA core part of the paper is the comparison of LLMs' fairness in tabular classification with traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. The results show that the fairness metric gap between different subgroups in LLMs is larger than in these traditional models, even after applying mitigation techniques to the LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides empirical evidence that, despite their generality, LLMs are currently less fair than specialized traditional ML models for tabular tasks, raising questions about the direct applicability of LLMs in sensitive tabular data applications where fairness is paramount ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper explicitly compares the fairness performance of LLMs for tabular data prediction to traditional machine learning models such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's finding that the fairness metric gap in LLMs is still larger than in traditional ML models, even after mitigation attempts, highlights a crucial difference in how biases manifest and are addressed in these two paradigms ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This suggests that the fairness challenges for LLMs are more complex due to their pre-training on vast, potentially biased, text corpora.\n## 8. Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThis project explores the role that fairness standards, broadly understood, can play in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It seeks to (1) map how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias; (2) consider the efficacy of, and gaps in, current standardisation efforts; and (3) analyse how these gaps should be filled for societally beneficial outcomes, with a particular focus on the role international standards bodies should play ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThis project seeks to map how standards are being used to mitigate LLM bias and consider the efficacy of, and gaps in, current standardisation efforts ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It will also analyse how these gaps should be filled for societally beneficial outcomes, with a particular focus on the role international standards bodies should play ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The project description implies that there are gaps in current standardization efforts related to mitigating LLM bias ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project aims to identify and analyze these gaps ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project aims to contribute to societally beneficial outcomes by addressing harmful biases in LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The concern about perpetuating negative stereotypes, erasing marginalised worldviews, and reinforcing political biases highlights the ethical considerations driving this research ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly aligns with ethical principles around fairness in AI, given its focus on investigating and highlighting social biases and their consequential implications for fairness in high-stake applications using tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The concern for \"fairness-related risks\" indicates a grounding in ethical considerations for AI deployment.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings underscore the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks and principles to guide the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, particularly when applied to domains where fairness is critical, such as tabular data used in high-stakes decision-making ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project's focus on the role of international standards bodies suggests an exploration of the governance aspects of implementing fairness standards for LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project will engage stakeholders from the public, private, and third sectors, indicating an approach that considers the practical challenges and diverse perspectives involved in governing LLM fairness ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: \n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper's findings about the persistence of bias even after mitigation efforts highlight a significant challenge in the practical implementation of fair LLMs, especially in applications like tabular data prediction. While not explicitly discussing governance structures, the focus on the \"consequential implications for fairness\" in high-stake applications implies the need for effective governance to ensure responsible deployment ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's results suggest that implementing fair LLMs in practice is challenging due to the inherent biases and the limitations of current mitigation techniques, pointing to a gap in effective implementation and governance strategies for ensuring fairness in real-world applications ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe project explicitly identifies gaps in current standardisation efforts as a key area of investigation, indicating a challenge in the current field ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project aims to analyze how these gaps should be filled, pointing towards future research directions focused on developing effective fairness standards and understanding the role of international standards bodies ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The abstract highlights the potential for LLMs to exacerbate harmful biases, implying a significant challenge in their current development and deployment ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The existence of gaps in current standardization efforts represents a limitation of current approaches to addressing this challenge ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the significant challenge that social biases are inherent within LLMs and inherited from their pretraining corpus, making them difficult to fully mitigate with downstream techniques ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The limited effectiveness of in-context learning and finetuning in closing the fairness gap compared to traditional ML models underscores the depth of this challenge.\nThe paper implicitly suggests future research directions should focus on developing mitigation strategies that can effectively address biases stemming from the pretraining phase, potentially through novel model architectures, pretraining methodologies, or more advanced prompting techniques that go beyond simple label-flipping. Further investigation into how LLMs utilize information for tabular tasks and how this process can be made more robust and fair is also a potential direction. Addressing the trade-offs between generality (LLMs) and task-specific fairness (traditional ML) is another area for future work.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nA key challenge identified is the inherent nature of social biases within LLMs, largely inherited from their pre-training corpus. These biases significantly impact fairness, particularly when LLMs are applied to tasks like tabular data prediction ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Another challenge is the limited effectiveness of current mitigation techniques, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, in eliminating the fairness gap compared to traditional models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The paper suggests that the biases are deeply rooted and not solely dependent on downstream task datasets ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Future research directions should focus on developing more effective strategies to address these inherent biases at their source, potentially through modifications to the pre-training process or novel fairness-aware architectures. Exploring alternative mitigation techniques beyond fine-tuning and in-context learning for tabular data prediction is also a crucial area. The challenge of scaling fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs and datasets is implicitly present, as the source of bias is the massive pre-training corpus.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings reveal a significant gap in current research regarding the effective mitigation of inherent biases in LLMs, especially for non-textual applications like tabular data, underscoring the need for more fundamental approaches to address bias at the pre-training level ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [fairness_standards_for_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper describes a project that aims to explore the role of fairness standards in mitigating harmful biases from LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. It highlights the potential for LLMs to perpetuate negative stereotypes, erase marginalised worldviews, and reinforce political biases, underscoring the importance of addressing bias and fairness ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project's focus on mapping existing standards, identifying gaps, and analyzing how to fill them through the involvement of international standards bodies represents a call to action for developing and implementing effective fairness standards for LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models']. The project's engagement with various stakeholders also emphasizes the collaborative effort required to achieve responsible development and deployment of LLMs ['fairness_standards_for_large_language_models'].\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data, significantly impacting their fairness in tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It emphasizes that these biases are inherent from the pretraining corpus and are not fully addressed by in-context learning or finetuning, as the fairness gap remains larger than in traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The finding that label-flipping in-context examples can reduce bias further highlights the presence of inherent bias ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper implicitly calls for a rethinking of LLM fairness, particularly in applied settings like tabular data, and a focus on addressing the root causes of bias in LLM pretraining.\n--------------------\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that LLMs inherit social biases from their pre-training data, leading to significant fairness issues when used for tabular data predictions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Current mitigation strategies like in-context learning and fine-tuning have limited success, and the fairness gap remains larger than that of traditional ML models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This highlights that biases are inherent to LLMs and not just derived from downstream tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The study emphasizes the crucial fairness-related risks associated with deploying LLMs in high-stake applications involving tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']."}, {"bibkey": "understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms", "content": "# 0. Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems that model and process human language, utilizing deep learning techniques for summarization, generation, and prediction of content ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Their \"large\" nature stems from the millions or billions of parameters required for training on extensive text data corpora ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are closely linked, aiming for a deep understanding of human language patterns and knowledge acquisition from large datasets ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs are becoming increasingly significant in the AI world, fueling the generative AI revolution and enabling applications like ChatGPT and Bard to mirror human conversations through advanced NLP systems ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs are widely used in various AI applications, including content creation, sentiment analysis, customer service, language translation, chatbots, personalized marketing, and data analytics ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The widespread use and increasing capabilities of LLMs raise concerns about the potential for bias, which is deeply embedded in the data used for training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Addressing bias and fairness is critical due to the ethical implications and the need for societal trust and acceptance of AI systems ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The purpose of this survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of understanding and mitigating bias in LLMs, highlighting the importance of tackling this unique challenge for responsible LLM development and deployment.\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThis section discusses the definition of bias in LLMs and the different forms it can take, emphasizing its origin in training data and human evaluation.\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs originates from unrepresentative samples or existing biases within the large datasets used for training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The model inherits and learns these biases, interpreting the biased data as factual ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Examples of LLM bias include gender, race, and cultural bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. For instance, gender bias can manifest if training data predominantly associates certain professions with specific genders (e.g., women as cleaners/nurses, men as engineers/CEOs), leading the LLM to perpetuate these societal stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Racial bias can result in LLMs reflecting stereotypes about certain ethnic groups ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Cultural bias can lead to overrepresentation to fit stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The two primary sources of bias in LLMs are data sources and human evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper primarily focuses on the consequences and mitigation of bias rather than offering detailed definitions or theoretical frameworks of different bias types. It lacks a formal typology or discussion on the conceptual bases beyond examples.\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLLMs are AI systems that model and process human language using deep learning techniques ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. They are called \"large\" because they require millions or billions of parameters for training on vast amounts of text data ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs work closely with NLP systems to achieve a high understanding of human language, its patterns, and knowledge learned from large datasets ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLMs employ Transformer models, a deep learning architecture that learns context and understanding through sequential data analysis ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The process involves tokenization, where input text is broken into smaller units (tokens) for processing ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Mathematical equations analyze the relationships between tokens using a probabilistic approach to predict the next sequence of words during training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The training phase involves feeding massive text datasets to the model to understand linguistic contexts, nuances, and styles, building a knowledge base to mimic human language ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The versatility and language comprehension of LLMs stem from training on extensive datasets across various genres and styles, enabling adaptation to different scenarios and contexts ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. However, this versatility highlights the challenge of bias, as the model's sole knowledge base comes from the potentially biased training data ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. When training data contains unrepresentative samples or biases, the model inherits and reflects these biases in its outputs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe problem of bias in LLMs is deeply rooted in the data used to train the models ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. When training data contains unrepresentative samples or biases, the model inherits and learns these biases, treating the ingested data as factual knowledge ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The two main origins of biases in LLMs are identified as data sources and human evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Examples of bias manifestation include gender, race, and cultural biases ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Gender bias can lead to stereotypical associations of professions with genders based on training data patterns ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Racial bias may cause LLMs to reflect stereotypes about certain ethnic groups ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Cultural bias can result in overrepresentation to fit existing stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The concern regarding LLMs and biases is particularly relevant when they are used in decision-making processes, raising ethical implications ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe training data used for LLMs is a significant source of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. If this data contains unrepresentative samples or is inherently biased, the LLM will inherit and learn these biases ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This occurs because the model uses the training data as its primary knowledge base and interprets it as factual ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Examples include training data where women are predominantly shown in roles like cleaners or nurses, while men are typically engineers or CEOs, leading the LLM to reflect these societal stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Similarly, racial bias can manifest if the data associates certain ethnic groups with stereotypes, and cultural bias can lead to overrepresentation to fit existing stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Data sources are identified as one of the two main origins of biases in LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper identifies data sources as a primary origin of bias and provides examples of how it manifests, it does not delve into the specific mechanisms or detailed empirical observations of how bias is introduced and propagated during data collection and preprocessing stages.\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nWhile the paper discusses model fine-tuning as a mitigation strategy, it does not explicitly detail how bias is introduced or propagated through the model architecture or the initial training process itself, beyond stating that the model learns from biased data.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper focuses on the data as the primary source of bias and mitigation techniques. It lacks a detailed analysis of how specific model architectures or training methodologies might inherently contribute to or exacerbate bias.\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nOrganizations need to implement multiple methods and metrics in their evaluation process before deploying AI systems like LLMs to the wider community ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This is crucial to ensure that different dimensions of bias in LLM outputs are captured ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nExamples of evaluation methods include human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or hybrid evaluation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. These methods are used to detect, estimate, or filter biases in LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Examples of metrics include accuracy, sentiment, and fairness ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. These metrics can provide feedback on the bias present in LLM outputs and assist in the continuous improvement of bias detection and reduction efforts ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper lists general types of evaluation methods (human, automatic, hybrid) and metrics (accuracy, sentiment, fairness) but does not provide specific details, mathematical formulations, or comparative analysis of these approaches for evaluating bias and fairness. It lacks the depth required for a comprehensive review of evaluation methodologies.\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly highlights the challenge of ensuring that evaluation methods and metrics effectively capture the different dimensions of bias in LLM outputs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This suggests a limitation in current evaluation approaches in fully encompassing the complexity of biases that can manifest.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper acknowledges the need for multiple methods and metrics but does not explicitly detail the challenges and limitations inherent in evaluating bias and fairness, such as the difficulty of measuring complex societal biases or the lack of standardized metrics.\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nSeveral strategies can be employed to mitigate bias in LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. These approaches focus on addressing bias at different stages, primarily through data and model modifications ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Implementing a strategic approach that combines various mitigation methods is necessary ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nData curation is a key strategy for mitigating LLM bias, focusing on the training data used for the models ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Companies should take responsibility for the type of data they input into models ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This involves ensuring that training data is curated from a diverse range of sources, including different demographics, languages, and cultures, to balance the representation of human language ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The aim is to prevent training data from containing unrepresentative samples and to support targeted model fine-tuning that reduces the impact of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper states that data curation helps balance representation and guides fine-tuning, which can reduce bias, but provides no specific experimental results or comparative data on the effectiveness of different data curation techniques.\nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper emphasizes the importance of diverse data sources, it does not detail specific data curation techniques, their computational costs, or empirical evidence comparing their effectiveness in bias reduction.\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nModel fine-tuning is another approach to improve accuracy and reduce biases after the initial training data has been processed ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. One fine-tuning approach mentioned is Transfer Learning, which involves using a pre-trained model and further training it on a smaller, more specific dataset to refine the model output, such as fine-tuning a general text data pre-trained model with legal documentation ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Bias Reduction Techniques can also be implemented, such as using a bias detection tool to identify and mitigate biases in training data ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Counterfactual data augmentation is a method that involves altering training data to break stereotypical associations and reduce gender, racial, or cultural biases in the model ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Another model-centric approach discussed is the integration of logical reasoning into LLMs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. A study integrated logical reasoning to build a neutral language model where relationships between tokens are considered neutral unless logic dictates otherwise ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Training a language model with this method reportedly resulted in reduced bias without needing more data or additional algorithm training ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Logic-aware language models are expected to avoid producing harmful stereotypes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper mentions that the logical reasoning approach resulted in a less biased model but does not provide specific quantitative experimental results or comparative data on the effectiveness or computational costs of different model fine-tuning or bias reduction techniques.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper introduces several model-centric techniques but lacks detailed mechanisms of how each technique reduces bias, comprehensive reported effectiveness, specific experimental comparisons, or analysis of computational costs and trade-offs associated with these methods.\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nAchieving a balance between reducing LLM bias and maintaining or improving the model's performance is a significant challenge ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. While debiasing models is essential for fairness, the model's performance and accuracy should ideally not be compromised ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. A strategic approach involving data curation, model fine-tuning, and the use of multiple evaluation methods is necessary to ensure that mitigation efforts do not negatively impact the model's ability to understand and generate language outputs ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. It is a process of trial and error, requiring monitoring, adjustment, debiasing, and continuous improvement ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper emphasizes the importance of balancing bias reduction and performance but provides no specific empirical evidence or comparative data illustrating the trade-offs between different mitigation strategies and their impact on performance or efficiency.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the general challenge of balancing bias reduction with performance but does not explicitly detail other overarching challenges such as the difficulty in achieving multiple fairness criteria simultaneously or the scalability of techniques for ever-larger LLMs and datasets.\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper presents real-world examples of bias mitigation efforts by major technology companies.\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\n## 8. Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper discusses the importance of addressing ethical concerns related to LLM bias and highlights initiatives by major companies to promote fairness.\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nGoogle Research has developed a set of tools called ‘Fairness Indicators’ aimed at detecting bias in machine learning models and facilitating a mitigating process ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. These indicators use metrics like false positives and false negatives to evaluate performance and identify biases that might be hidden by general metrics ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While Google's Fairness Indicators are mentioned, the paper does not discuss formal standard development or usage, gaps in standardization, or proposed roles for various stakeholders in developing and adopting standards.\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe ethical concerns surrounding LLM bias are significant, particularly regarding the use of LLMs in decision-making processes ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The impacts of bias, such as the reinforcement of stereotypes and discrimination, raise ethical dilemmas ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. OpenAI emphasizes safety, privacy, and ethical concerns as forefront goals in their work ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper touches upon the ethical implications of LLM bias but does not explicitly delve into detailed ethical frameworks or principles guiding fairness in AI and LLMs beyond a general acknowledgment of the importance of addressing these issues.\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights the need for organizations to prioritize addressing LLM bias for society to trust and accept AI systems ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. This implies challenges in implementing fairness in real-world deployment and the importance of responsible development ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions the need for societal trust and responsible development as motivators for addressing bias but does not detail specific practical difficulties, governance structures, or strategies related to implementing fairness standards and ensuring governance in real-world LLM deployment.\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nLLM bias is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that requires prioritization for societal trust and acceptance of AI integration ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Organizations need to understand the negative impact of stereotypes and use this understanding to establish pathways for mitigating LLM biases through data curation, model fine-tuning, and logical modeling ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. A significant challenge is achieving a balance between reducing bias and maintaining or improving model performance ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Debiasing is imperative for fairness, but performance and accuracy should not be compromised, requiring a strategic approach and continuous monitoring and adjustment ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The paper implicitly suggests future research directions in improving data curation techniques, refining model fine-tuning methods (including the integration of logic), and developing better evaluation methodologies that can capture different dimensions of bias ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. The need for continuous improvement in detecting and mitigating biases also points towards ongoing research requirements ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper identifies the fundamental challenge of balancing bias reduction and performance and highlights the need for continued efforts in mitigation and evaluation. However, it does not explicitly detail a comprehensive list of remaining challenges or propose specific, granular future research directions beyond the general areas of data, model, and evaluation improvements. It lacks a discussion on the challenges of scaling fairness efforts to increasingly large models and datasets.\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThe article covers what LLMs are, their underlying mechanism, the problem of bias in LLMs and its impact, and strategies for mitigating LLM bias, including real-world examples ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. LLM bias is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that must be prioritized to foster greater societal trust and acceptance of AI systems ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms']. Organizations are urged to understand the lasting negative impact of stereotypes and use this knowledge to establish effective pathways for mitigating LLM biases through approaches like data curation, model fine-tuning, and logical modeling ['understanding_and_mitigating_bias_in_large_language_models_llms'].

Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nThis section explores the definitions of bias and fairness in the context of LLMs ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. Bias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that unfairly favor one group and disadvantage another in a model's predictions ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms']. Fairness in AI is about ensuring the system treats all users equally and avoids perpetuating societal inequities ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that a model might make regarding its predictions that unfairly favour one group and disadvantage another ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms]\nDigest: \nFairness in AI is about having the system treat all users equally and avoiding the perpetuation of societal inequities ['understanding_bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_llms'].

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nThe adoption of AI and generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is becoming increasingly widespread with a predicted significant impact across industries due to efficiency and productivity enhancements ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Large language model (LLM) generative AI holds transformative potential for content creation ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. However, as this technology moves into a new phase, understanding its limitations, particularly the potential biases ingrained within these systems, is crucial for responsible and equitable implementation ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Addressing these biases is paramount before fully integrating LLM-based technologies into corporate tech stacks ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nPrudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases that can emerge during training and deployment ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. These biases are a critical concern beneath the capabilities of LLMs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nSeveral biases can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nMachine bias refers to biases present in the training data, which LLMs absorb and perpetuate stereotypes and discriminations present in vast human-generated datasets, leading to biased outputs pertaining to race, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nAvailability bias stems from LLMs being exposed to large amounts of publicly available data, favoring more readily available content and neglecting less prevalent online perspectives ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. This can create information bubbles and echo chambers, reinforcing existing biases and potentially leading to misinformation if it is more readily available than factual content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nConfirmation bias is a psychological tendency reflected in the training data or prompt writing, where the AI may selectively generate content that reinforces users' existing viewpoints ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nSelection bias emerges when training data is not representative of the entire population or target audience, leading to a lack of knowledge for unbiased and comprehensive content generation if certain groups are underrepresented or excluded ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. For example, data primarily from Western countries may cause the AI to struggle with culturally relevant content for non-Western audiences, perpetuating societal inequalities ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nGroup attribution bias emerges when the AI attributes specific characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on the actions of a few, potentially associating negative attributes with specific ethnicities or genders and perpetuating harmful generalizations ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nContextual bias arises when the LLM struggles to accurately understand or interpret the context of a conversation or prompt, potentially leading to inappropriate or misleading responses ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nLinguistic bias occurs when the AI favors certain linguistic styles, vocabularies, or cultural references, resulting in content more relatable to certain language groups or cultures while alienating others ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nAnchoring bias occurs when the AI relies too heavily on initial information, incorporating early biases from training data and perpetuating them ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nAutomation bias refers to the human tendency to blindly trust AI-generated outputs without critical evaluation, placing unwarranted trust in AI systems ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. This is a concerning bias as it can lead to the dissemination of false or biased information ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides a list of bias types but does not offer a formal taxonomy or discuss the conceptual bases of these biases in detail beyond their manifestation in LLMs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation]\nDigest: \nLLM generative AI models learn from vast human-generated datasets ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. The biases present in this training data are absorbed by the models ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Since the models are exposed to large amounts of publicly available data, they are more likely to favor content that is more readily available ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. If the training data is not representative of the entire population, the model will lack the necessary knowledge to generate unbiased content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Biases can also be introduced in how prompts are written ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. The AI model relies heavily on the initial information it receives, which could lead to incorporating early biases ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. The model's struggle to understand context can lead to inappropriate responses ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

Availability bias arises because models are exposed to publicly available data, favoring prevalent content and neglecting less common perspectives ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Selection bias occurs when training data is not representative, excluding or underrepresenting certain groups ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Group attribution bias can be perpetuated if datasets do not reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Anchoring bias can take hold if the initial information provided to the model during training incorporates biases ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper identifies data as a source of bias but does not detail specific data collection or preprocessing techniques that introduce or mitigate bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

Prudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Data scientists need to fine-tune the model and carefully curate their prompts to better comprehend the context and avoid generating contextually inappropriate or biased content ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Data scientists should work to ensure the AI model remains linguistically neutral and adapts to various language styles ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Data scientists must carefully curate the initial information provided to the model and continuously monitor its outputs ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Exercising skepticism and independently verifying generated content is crucial to avoid propagating false or biased information ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

Implementing robust governance mechanisms for big data, including transparent guidelines for data collection, can help identify and minimize biases in training data ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. To avoid group attribution bias, LLM models must be trained on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation']. Carefully curating the initial information provided to the model helps prevent anchoring bias ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper emphasizes the importance of diverse and inclusive datasets and robust data governance, it does not provide specific data-centric mitigation techniques like data augmentation, re-sampling, or bias detection methods applied to datasets ['navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation'].

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various NLP tasks due to their ability to generate human-like text, translate languages, answer questions, and perform other complex linguistic tasks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. However, their increasing use and societal impact necessitate a critical examination of their potential for bias and unfairness ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of bias and fairness in LLMs, covering definitions, sources, evaluation methods, mitigation strategies, and future research directions ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Addressing bias and fairness is crucial for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, ensuring they benefit society equitably ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs is defined as systematic and unfair discrimination or prejudice against certain groups or individuals, often stemming from the data they are trained on ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The survey discusses various types of biases, including social biases (e.g., gender, racial, religious), demographic biases (based on attributes like age, nationality, disability), representational biases (underrepresentation or misrepresentation of certain groups), and cognitive biases (systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment) ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These biases can manifest in various ways, such as generating stereotypical content, exhibiting prejudice in downstream tasks, or reflecting harmful societal norms ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Defining and categorizing the vast array of biases present in LLMs is challenging due to their complex interactions and the nuances of human language and societal structures ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is a lack of a universally agreed-upon taxonomy that captures all forms of bias in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nFairness in LLMs aims to ensure that the model's outputs and behaviors are equitable and do not unjustly discriminate against any group ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Various conceptualizations of fairness exist, including group fairness (treating different demographic groups equally) and individual fairness (treating similar individuals similarly) ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Quantitative metrics are used to measure fairness, although the paper does not explicitly provide mathematical formulations like demographic parity or equalized odds in the excerpt provided ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The underlying ethical principles often relate to non-discrimination, equity, and justice ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Defining and measuring fairness in complex LLMs is challenging due to the multifaceted nature of fairness and the difficulty in translating ethical principles into quantifiable metrics ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is no single metric that can capture all aspects of fairness, and different metrics may be in conflict with each other ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nLLMs are typically based on transformer architectures and are trained on massive datasets of text and code ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text stems from learning complex patterns and relationships within this vast data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Bias can be introduced and propagated throughout the LLM lifecycle, from data collection to deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The scale and characteristics of the training data play a significant role in embedding societal biases into the model ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The learning paradigm, which involves predicting the next token based on the preceding context, can reinforce biased patterns present in the data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Emergent properties in larger models can also lead to unexpected and sometimes biased behaviors ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Probabilistic generation, where the model samples from a probability distribution over possible next tokens, can also reflect and perpetuate biases learned from the training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs is not limited to a single source but can arise at different stages of their development and deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nBias can be introduced during data collection through the selection of unrepresentative or biased sources, leading to a skewed representation of different demographic groups or perspectives ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Preprocessing steps, such as tokenization or filtering, can also inadvertently amplify or introduce biases ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For instance, if the training data contains a disproportionate amount of text associating certain professions with specific genders, the model may learn and perpetuate these stereotypes ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The sheer scale and diversity of LLM training data make it extremely challenging to identify and remove all sources of bias during data collection and preprocessing ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Data cleaning and augmentation techniques can be computationally expensive and may not fully address deeply embedded biases ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nWhile model architectures themselves are generally designed to be neutral, the training process can reinforce biases present in the data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The optimization objectives and training algorithms can prioritize patterns that reflect societal biases, especially if these biases are prevalent in the training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For example, if the training data contains biased language, the model may learn to generate similar biased language ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Developing training algorithms that are inherently fairness-aware while maintaining model performance is a significant challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The complex internal workings of large neural networks can make it difficult to pinpoint exactly how and why biases are learned and propagated during training ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEven if a model is trained on relatively unbiased data and with fairness-aware algorithms, bias can still emerge during post-training fine-tuning or deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Fine-tuning on smaller, potentially biased datasets can introduce new biases or amplify existing ones ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The way LLMs are prompted and used in specific applications can also reveal or exacerbate biases ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. For example, a model might exhibit bias when generating text for a specific task, even if it appears unbiased on general language generation benchmarks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Addressing bias at the deployment stage is reactive and may not fully mitigate the harm caused by biased outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The wide range of potential applications and user interactions makes it difficult to anticipate and prevent all forms of bias manifestation in deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEvaluating bias and fairness in LLMs requires specific methodologies and benchmarks to detect and quantify discriminatory behavior ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nNumerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate different types of bias in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper mentions several, including BBQ, BEC-Pro, Bias NLI, BOLD, BUG, CrowS-Pairs, Equity Evaluation Corpus, GAP, Grep-BiasIR, HolisticBias, HONEST, PANDA, RealToxicityPrompts, RedditBias, StereoSet, TrustGPT, UnQover, WinoBias, WinoBias+, WinoGender, and WinoQueer ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These benchmarks often focus on specific types of biases, such as gender, racial, or social biases, and employ various methodologies to elicit and measure biased responses from LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper points to the existence of these benchmarks but does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While numerous benchmarks exist, they often focus on specific types of bias and may not capture the full spectrum of biases present in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is a need for more comprehensive and standardized benchmarks that can evaluate fairness across different demographic groups, tasks, and languages ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The dynamic nature of LLMs and their evolving capabilities also pose a challenge for developing static benchmarks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nVarious metrics and methodologies are used to assess fairness in LLMs, often adapted from traditional fairness metrics in machine learning ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These can include metrics based on disparities in performance or output distributions across different demographic groups ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Methodologies might involve analyzing model outputs for stereotypical associations, harmful language, or discriminatory behavior in specific tasks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper discusses the use of fairness metrics but does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Applying traditional fairness metrics to the complex and generative outputs of LLMs can be challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Many existing metrics are designed for classification tasks and may not be directly applicable to text generation or other complex LLM outputs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Defining and measuring fairness for open-ended text generation remains an open research problem ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEvaluating bias and fairness in LLMs is fraught with challenges. These include the inherent difficulty in defining and measuring complex societal biases, which are often nuanced and context-dependent ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The dynamic and evolving nature of LLMs means that biases can manifest in novel and unpredictable ways ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is a lack of universally accepted standards and metrics for evaluating LLM fairness, making it difficult to compare results across different studies ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The large scale of LLMs and their training data also makes comprehensive evaluation computationally expensive and time-consuming ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Current evaluation methods often provide only a partial view of LLM bias, focusing on specific types of bias or tasks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Developing robust and comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can capture the multifaceted nature of bias in LLMs is an ongoing challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nVarious strategies have been proposed to mitigate bias in LLMs, targeting different stages of the LLM lifecycle ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nData-centric mitigation techniques focus on addressing bias in the training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This can involve curating more representative datasets, augmenting data to balance demographic distributions, or filtering out biased content ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The principle is to reduce the exposure of the model to biased patterns during training ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper describes data-centric approaches but does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data on their effectiveness within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Curating truly unbiased and representative datasets is a significant undertaking, especially given the scale of LLM training data ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Data augmentation and filtering techniques may not fully eliminate deeply embedded biases and can sometimes inadvertently introduce new ones ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nModel-centric mitigation techniques involve modifying the LLM or its training process to reduce bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This can include fairness-aware training algorithms, adversarial training to make the model less sensitive to sensitive attributes, or fine-tuning on debiased datasets ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The mechanism is to influence the model's learning process to favor less biased outcomes ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper describes model-centric approaches but does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data on their effectiveness within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Developing effective model-centric mitigation techniques that do not significantly compromise model performance is challenging ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These techniques often require significant computational resources and expertise to implement and tune ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The interpretability of how these techniques reduce bias in complex LLMs is also limited ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nPost-processing techniques are applied after the LLM has generated an output to mitigate bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. This can involve re-ranking generated outputs, filtering out biased responses, or using external fairness filters ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The principle is to adjust the model's output to be less biased without modifying the model itself ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper describes post-processing techniques but does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data on their effectiveness within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Post-processing is often a reactive approach and may not address the root causes of bias in the LLM ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These techniques can sometimes be difficult to implement effectively and may not generalize well across different tasks and types of bias ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nMitigating bias in LLMs faces significant challenges and trade-offs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. It is often difficult to achieve multiple fairness criteria simultaneously, as improving fairness with respect to one protected attribute may negatively impact fairness with respect to another ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There can be a trade-off between fairness and model performance or efficiency, where achieving higher fairness may lead to a decrease in overall accuracy or an increase in computational cost ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Scaling fairness efforts to the ever-increasing size of LLMs and datasets is a major challenge ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper highlights these challenges but does not provide specific experimental results illustrating the trade-offs within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The lack of a unified framework for evaluating and comparing different mitigation strategies makes it difficult to determine the most effective approaches ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Many mitigation techniques are still in their early stages of development and require further research to assess their long-term impact and scalability ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 7.

There are gaps in current standardization efforts, and the paper implicitly suggests a need for more comprehensive and widely adopted standards ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper does not explicitly detail specific proposed roles for stakeholders or challenges in practical implementation within the accessible abstract and provided information ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The rapidly evolving nature of LLMs makes it challenging to develop and maintain relevant standards ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Achieving consensus among diverse stakeholders on what constitutes fair behavior and how to measure it is also a significant hurdle ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nEthical frameworks and principles provide the conceptual basis for understanding and addressing fairness in LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These often draw upon principles from ethics, philosophy, and social justice, such as non-discrimination, accountability, and transparency ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The paper highlights the importance of these underlying principles in guiding the development and deployment of fair LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Translating abstract ethical principles into concrete technical requirements and evaluation metrics for LLMs is a complex task ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There can be differing interpretations of ethical principles, leading to disagreements on how to achieve fairness in practice ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nImplementing fairness standards and ensuring effective governance in the real-world deployment of LLMs presents practical difficulties ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. These challenges include the lack of clear regulatory frameworks, the difficulty in enforcing fairness standards across different applications and contexts, and the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of LLM behavior in deployment ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Practical strategies might involve establishing responsible AI committees, implementing transparency mechanisms, and developing accountability frameworks ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\nCritique of Existing Work: Current governance structures and regulatory frameworks are often not equipped to handle the unique challenges posed by LLMs ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Ensuring compliance with fairness principles in complex and rapidly evolving systems like LLMs requires ongoing effort and adaptation ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey]\nDigest: \nAddressing bias and fairness in LLMs is a multifaceted challenge with several remaining limitations and open research questions ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Overarching challenges include the difficulty in comprehensively evaluating bias, the trade-offs associated with mitigation techniques, and the scalability of fairness efforts to larger models and datasets ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Future research directions include developing more robust and comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and methodologies ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. There is a need for novel fairness-aware training algorithms that can effectively mitigate bias without compromising performance ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Exploring interdisciplinary approaches that combine technical expertise with insights from social sciences, ethics, and law is also crucial ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. The societal implications of LLM bias and the role of policy and regulation in promoting fairness are also important areas for future investigation ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey']. Challenges related to scaling fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs and datasets involve developing efficient and scalable mitigation techniques and evaluation methods ['bias_and_fairness_in_large_language_models_a_survey'].\n## 10.

Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAI systems can replicate human bias, which is amplified with the rise of large language models (LLMs) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Bias in AI Systems (AISs) can lead to incorrect decisions or discrimination, negatively affecting individuals and social groups, as shown by studies revealing that job descriptions created by generative AI convey significantly more stereotypes than those written by humans ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The increasing popularity and integration of LLMs into large-scale applications across various fields, from virtual assistance to content generation, and their use in search engines or office suites, highlight the critical need to understand and manage bias to ensure fair and accountable systems ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The growing significance of this issue is reflected in the 25% increase in scientific papers on fairness and bias since 2022, according to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nA bias can be defined as a deviation from the norm in AI ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Four broad families of bias are identified: statistical bias (e.g., using an average that oversimplifies), methodological bias (e.g., using an inaccurate device or out-of-date training data), cognitive bias (e.g., making a subjective or irrational decision), and socio-historical bias (e.g., training on data from a single country and using the model in others with different worldviews) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Biases in LLMs can manifest as harms of allocation (unjust distribution of resources, immediate and easy to formalize) or harms of representation (reinforcement of stereotypes, long-term and difficult to formalize) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Bias can appear within the model's internal representations (intrinsic bias) and in final decisions (extrinsic bias) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides a high-level categorization of bias types but does not delve into the nuances or complexities of these categories or the challenges in distinguishing between them in practice within LLMs.\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper does not define or provide mathematical formulations for fairness metrics like demographic parity or equalized odds. It mentions choosing \"fairness criteria\" as a necessary first step in a corporate action plan, but does not elaborate on what these criteria might be or how they are defined ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nA Language Model (LM) is a statistical model designed to represent natural language ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. LLMs are advanced versions trained on vast data sets using sophisticated architectures ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Their ability to understand and generate text coherently and contextually is revolutionizing NLP applications, improving machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, and human-machine interaction systems ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The development pipeline of generative LLMs typically consists of a basic model for encoding language and rules, followed by a fine-tuned model to respond to specific instructions . This fine-tuned model can be further tailored for specific tasks or aligned with stated values ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in AISs arises from the data sets used for training, architecture choices, and inappropriate usage ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. In LLMs, the huge scale of pre-training data sets, the adaptation process (alignment with human values, specialization), bias mitigation choices, and the nature of the prompt can cause harms of allocation or representation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBiases in LLMs can arise from the data sets used to train the model ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. A socio-historical bias can occur if an LLM is trained on data from a single country and then used in others with different worldviews ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Methodological bias can result from using LLMs trained on data sets that are not current ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions that biases arise from datasets but does not provide specific examples or detailed mechanisms of how data collection or preprocessing introduces bias.\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBiases in AISs can arise from architecture choices ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The vast scale of the pre-training datasets and the adaptation process in LLMs can contribute to bias ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions architecture choices and training scale as sources of bias but lacks specific examples or detailed mechanisms related to model architecture or training procedures beyond the scale of data.\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBiases in AISs can arise from inappropriate usage ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The nature of the Prompt (e.g., what kind of roleplay) can cause harms ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Biases in LLMs can manifest in the final decisions they take (extrinsic bias) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Post-generation self-diagnosis involves designing specific instructions to steer the model towards generating fairer and less biased responses based on its ability to evaluate its own outputs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Carefully formulated prompts can force the model to adopt varied perspectives and avoid stereotypes ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Prompt engineering with roleplay can be effective in revealing and mitigating certain biases ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Adjusting the temperature parameter can control the creativity and diversity of responses, influencing the deterministic nature of the output ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Instructions in the prompt provide clear guidance to minimize ambiguity and steer the model ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Adding context at the beginning of the prompt provides general information to facilitate understanding and guide responses ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Providing examples at the end of the prompt can help the model understand the task ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Using a system prompt can add guidelines to limit responses to a specific format ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper details prompt engineering and post-generation self-diagnosis as post-training mitigation strategies, it does not extensively discuss other mechanisms of bias manifestation during deployment or how user interaction patterns might introduce bias.\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs can be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Intrinsic methods analyze relationships between words in the model's internal representations or observe differences in how the model assigns probabilities to words ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Extrinsic methods focus on the model's performance on specific tasks ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Evaluation metrics specific to traditional NLP tasks measure the quality of LLMs on reference data sets or generated text ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks, comprising a test data set and NLP task-specific evaluation metrics, measure the quality and effectiveness of models on tasks like machine translation or text generation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks measure the quality and effectiveness of models on specific tasks such as machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis, etc., allowing comparison between models based on objective and reproducible criteria ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. A benchmark is an ensemble comprising a body of data, tasks, and evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides a general overview of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods and the role of benchmarks but does not provide specific examples of metrics or the mathematical formulations required by the prompt.\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBenchmarks comprise a test data set and NLP task-specific evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks can be used to measure the quality and effectiveness of models on specific tasks ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The test data sets used in benchmarks can bring their own biases, making the suitability of the benchmarks a key issue ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Developing a benchmark requires collecting data, annotating it if necessary, defining the task, and establishing evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Comparing different LLMs using an existing or ad hoc developed benchmark is part of a corporate action plan for managing bias ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Selecting the least biased model involves comparing the results of different models on the benchmark ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data from using benchmarks.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the potential for bias in benchmark datasets themselves but does not offer specific examples of biased benchmarks or discuss methods for creating debiased benchmarks.\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nExtrinsic evaluation methods focus on how the model performs at specific tasks using evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Evaluation metrics specific to traditional NLP tasks measure the quality of LLMs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Benchmarks include NLP task-specific evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Developing a benchmark requires establishing how to measure that the task has been performed well using evaluation metrics ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Choosing fairness criteria is a necessary first step in managing LLM bias within a corporate action plan ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data using fairness metrics.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper lacks detail on specific fairness metrics and their application, only generally referring to \"evaluation metrics\" and \"fairness criteria\" without defining them or discussing their limitations.\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe test data sets used in benchmarks can bring their own biases, highlighting the key issue of benchmark suitability when evaluating LLMs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Managing LLM bias remains a complex and evolving subject, and while there are ways to evaluate bias, the area is not yet fully mature ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper briefly mentions the challenge of biased benchmark datasets but does not provide a comprehensive discussion of other challenges in LLM bias evaluation, such as the difficulty in measuring complex societal biases or the lack of standardized metrics.\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nBias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions that biases in AISs arise from datasets but does not discuss data-centric mitigation techniques like data cleaning, augmentation, or creating representative datasets.\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAdditional training for bias mitigation may entail supervised or semi-supervised fine-tuning or methods to align models with expected values (via reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These methods can adjust models to reduce bias while maintaining performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data for model-centric mitigation techniques.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper describes model-centric mitigation methods as resource-intensive and potentially introducing new biases from the added data ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. It also notes that the area of bias management is not yet fully mature, implying limitations in current mitigation strategies ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nIn the absence of additional training, techniques such as post-generation self-diagnosis or prompt engineering can be used ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. These techniques are simpler, require less expertise, and are easier to implement ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Post-generation self-diagnosis involves designing specific instructions for the model to evaluate its own outputs based on predefined criteria (e.g., bias, stereotyping, toxicity) and adjust or regenerate responses if deemed biased or inappropriate ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Carefully formulated prompts can steer the model towards fairer responses by forcing varied perspectives and avoiding stereotypes ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Prompt engineering with roleplay can reveal and mitigate biases by having the model respond as a specific profile ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Optimizing the prompt by comparing results obtained on a benchmark with different prompts is a step in managing bias ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Model performance can vary with prompt parameters like temperature, instruction, context, examples, and system prompt ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper does not provide specific experimental results or comparative data for post-processing techniques.\nCritique of Existing Work: While the paper details prompt engineering and post-generation self-diagnosis, it doesn't provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness in reducing bias compared to other methods. The discussion of prompt parameters is descriptive rather than analytical regarding their impact on bias reduction.\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nModel-centric mitigation methods, while effective, are resource-intensive and can introduce new opinions or representations, leading to new biases consubstantial with the new data used for mitigation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Vigilance and compromise are sometimes necessary to ensure that bias-mitigation actions do not harm the model's performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper states that model performance may vary according to prompt parameters but does not provide specific experimental results quantifying this variation or the trade-offs with bias reduction ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the trade-off between bias mitigation and model performance and the potential for new biases from additional training data. However, it doesn't discuss the difficulty in achieving multiple fairness criteria simultaneously or the scalability of techniques for large LLMs.\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nAI systems can replicate human bias, which has become amplified with the rise of large language models. This has led to concerns in various applications. For example, a recent study revealed that job descriptions created by generative AI convey far more stereotypes than those written by people ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. This demonstrates a concrete instance of representational harm in a specific application (content generation for recruitment).\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper provides one example related to job descriptions but does not offer a broad analysis of fairness in various LLM applications or detailed case studies.\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n## 8. Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe European Union regulation on artificial intelligence (AI Act), which came into force on 1 August 2024, aims to regulate the development, marketing, and use of AISs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The Act classifies AISs by risk level ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. High-risk systems, such as those assisting with recruitment, are subject to additional requirements, including putting in place appropriate measures to detect, prevent, and mitigate possible biases in training data sets, particularly if biases could affect health, safety, fundamental rights, or lead to discrimination ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Limited-risk chatbots are subject only to transparency obligations ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Appropriate governance is vital and should include establishing guidelines for managing bias, appointing ethics officers and training managers, and implementing active monitoring and development of technical tools ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. It is vital that the teams involved in developing AISs are diverse ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper mentions the AI Act as a relevant regulatory framework and the need for corporate governance but does not delve into the specifics of proposed standards, detailed ethical frameworks, or the practical challenges of implementing these in diverse organizational contexts.\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe European Union's AI Act is mentioned as a regulation aiming to regulate AISs and includes requirements for high-risk systems to mitigate biases in datasets ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The Act outlines different risk levels for AISs with corresponding obligations, such as transparency for limited-risk chatbots and strict bias management for high-risk systems like recruitment tools ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the AI Act as a key regulatory development but does not provide details on specific technical standards or guidelines for achieving fairness within the framework. It also doesn't discuss the challenges in developing and adopting such standards.\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe paper notes that biases in LLMs can cause harms of allocation (unjust distribution of resources) or representation (reinforcement of stereotypes) ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The AI Act's focus on preventing discrimination and negative impacts on fundamental rights underscores underlying ethical principles related to fairness and non-discrimination in AI deployment ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Aligning models with expected values via reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics is mentioned as a mitigation strategy, implicitly referencing the ethical goal of producing desirable and fair outputs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. A corporate action plan includes aligning models with stated values, such as adherence to a company's ethical charter ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Choosing the fairness criteria is the first step in managing bias within a corporate framework ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper touches upon the ethical implications of bias (harms of allocation/representation, discrimination) and the concept of aligning models with values. However, it does not detail specific ethical frameworks or principles that guide fairness in AI and LLMs beyond the regulatory context of the AI Act.\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nThe AI Act's requirements for high-risk systems to implement bias mitigation measures highlight the challenge of implementing fairness in practice, especially for systems with significant societal impact ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Appropriate governance is essential, involving establishing guidelines, appointing responsible personnel, and implementing active monitoring and tool development ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. A diverse development team is considered vital for managing bias in AISs ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Corporate action plans involve choosing fairness criteria, identifying tasks and known biases, comparing different LLMs using benchmarks, selecting the least biased model, and optimizing prompts ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Testing and adjusting models according to specific use cases is essential ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper outlines key aspects of practical implementation and governance, including regulatory requirements, internal governance structures, team diversity, and a step-by-step corporate action plan. However, it does not provide in-depth analysis of the practical difficulties encountered in deploying fair LLMs at scale or the effectiveness of different governance structures in ensuring fairness.\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nManaging LLM bias remains a complex and evolving subject, and the area is not yet fully mature ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. While evaluation and mitigation methods exist, they are not fully mature ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Model-centric mitigation methods are resource-intensive and can introduce new biases ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Vigilance and compromise are needed to balance bias mitigation with performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The suitability of benchmarks is a key issue due to potential biases in test datasets ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The focus within companies is currently on organization, developing prototypes, and experimenting ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper identifies the overall immaturity and complexity of LLM bias management and some specific challenges related to mitigation techniques and evaluation benchmarks. However, it lacks a comprehensive synthesis of challenges identified throughout the field and does not propose specific future research directions beyond general statements about the evolving nature of the field and ongoing corporate experimentation.\nExplicitly prompt for challenges related to scaling fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs and datasets.:\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms]\nDigest: \nManaging LLM bias is a complex and evolving subject, with existing evaluation and mitigation methods not yet fully mature ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Bias in LLMs is amplified due to their scale and can manifest in various forms, leading to potential harms ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Evaluation methods include intrinsic and extrinsic approaches using metrics and benchmarks, although benchmark suitability is a concern due to potential dataset biases ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Mitigation can involve additional training (fine-tuning, alignment), which is resource-intensive and may introduce new biases, or techniques without additional training (post-generation self-diagnosis, prompt engineering), which are simpler but require careful implementation and can impact performance ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act and corporate governance are crucial for addressing bias, emphasizing the need for guidelines, responsible teams, and continuous monitoring ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. A corporate action plan involves choosing fairness criteria, evaluating models with benchmarks, selecting less biased models, and optimizing prompts ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. Developing fair and accountable LLMs is essential for their large-scale adoption ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']. The current focus in companies is on organization, prototyping, and experimentation ['how_to_avoid_replicating_bias_and_human_error_in_llms']."}, {"bibkey": "ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models", "content": "# 0. Bias_and_Fairness_in_LLMs\n## 1. Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nAs Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, concerns regarding the potential negative societal impacts of LLM-generated content have also arisen ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].

The curation of CEB is based on a newly proposed compositional taxonomy ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. This benchmark covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models]\nDigest: \nThe paper proposes CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models']. Its design rationale is based on a compositional taxonomy covering bias types, social groups, and tasks to provide a comprehensive evaluation strategy ['ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models'].

Introduction\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for various tasks, including prediction on tabular data, a domain often used in high-stakes applications ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases, reflecting societal stereotypes and inequalities ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This raises significant concerns about fairness, particularly when LLMs are applied to sensitive tabular prediction tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Addressing bias and fairness in LLMs is critical due to their increasing societal impact and widespread deployment ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 2. Theoretical Frameworks of Bias and Fairness in LLMs\n### 2.1 Definitions and Typologies of Bias\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights \"social biases\" as a key concern, specifically in the context of LLMs making predictions on tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. These biases are described as reflecting \"stereotypes and inequalities present in the society\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates the impact of social biases on fairness in tabular prediction tasks performed by LLMs and quantifies the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While the specific fairness metrics used are not explicitly named in the abstract, the focus on differences between subgroups suggests the potential use of group fairness metrics such as demographic parity or equalized odds.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the assumption that fairness in LLMs for tabular data can be easily achieved, demonstrating that biases are deeply inherent and mitigation strategies like in-context learning and fine-tuning only have a \"moderate effect\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This highlights a gap in current understanding regarding the persistence of bias in LLMs even after mitigation attempts.\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly refers to the mechanism by which LLMs process information and generate predictions, stating that they \"draw upon\" sources of information when making predictions for tabular tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. It emphasizes that LLMs \"inherit social biases from their training data\" which then impact their predictions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The pre-training corpus is identified as a significant source of inherent bias within LLMs ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe primary source of bias identified in the paper is the LLMs' \"training data\" and their \"pre-training corpus\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Social biases are inherited from these sources and significantly impact fairness in downstream tasks like tabular prediction ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The paper suggests that these biases are \"inherent within the LLMs themselves\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper identifies the \"pre-training corpus\" as a source from which LLMs inherit social biases ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While the specific mechanisms of bias introduction during data collection and preprocessing are not detailed, the finding that biases are inherent suggests that the large-scale and uncurated nature of typical LLM training data likely contributes to this issue.\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper suggests that social biases are \"inherent within the LLMs themselves\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This implies that the model architecture and training process, while not explicitly detailed as separate bias sources, contribute to the absorption and manifestation of biases from the training data.\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates the effects of in-context learning and fine-tuning, which are post-training techniques, on bias mitigation ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The observation that these techniques have only a \"moderate effect\" suggests that biases persist even after these interventions ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates fairness by measuring the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" in tabular prediction tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This implies a methodology involving evaluating predictions on different demographic or social groups within the tabular data.\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper conducts experiments using tabular data to assess LLM fairness ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While specific benchmark datasets are not named in the abstract, the experiments are performed on this type of data.\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper quantifies the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This methodology involves comparing prediction outcomes for different sensitive groups.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper's experiments show that the fairness metric gap in LLMs is \"still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This provides comparative data highlighting the relative lack of fairness in LLMs for this task.\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper's findings implicitly highlight the challenge of achieving sufficient fairness in LLMs for tabular data, even with mitigation attempts ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The persistent fairness gap compared to traditional models suggests that current evaluation methods, while capable of detecting bias, underscore the difficulty in fully eliminating it.\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores in-context learning and fine-tuning as potential mitigation strategies for bias in LLMs applied to tabular data ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates the effect of \"label-flipping of in-context examples\" as a technique to reduce biases ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This can be considered a data-centric approach applied to the in-context learning paradigm. The results show that this technique can \"significantly reduce biases\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines \"fine-tuning\" as a mitigation strategy ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This is a model-centric approach aimed at adapting the pre-trained LLM to the downstream task while potentially reducing bias.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: Fine-tuning is reported to have a \"moderate effect\" on reducing the fairness metric gap ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights a significant challenge in bias mitigation: despite using techniques like in-context learning and fine-tuning, the fairness metric gap in LLMs for tabular data remains larger than that of traditional ML models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This suggests that current mitigation strategies are only moderately effective and face limitations in fully addressing the inherent biases within LLMs ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. There's a trade-off in that achieving comparable fairness to traditional models with LLMs appears difficult with these methods.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The comparison of LLMs with traditional models after mitigation attempts demonstrates the limited effectiveness of the explored strategies ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper focuses specifically on the application of LLMs for predictions on \"tabular data\" and investigates the \"fairness-related risks associated with utilizing LLMs for predictions on tabular data\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This serves as a specific case study within the broader context of LLM fairness.\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates that LLMs \"inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular prediction tasks\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This highlights a unique challenge in this domain as LLMs are not traditionally designed for structured tabular data. The evaluation method involves assessing the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While in-context learning and fine-tuning are explored as solutions, they only have a \"moderate effect\" on improving fairness in this context ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The ethical consideration is the widespread use of tabular data in \"many high-stake applications\" where fairness is crucial ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper reveals that despite attempts at mitigation, LLMs exhibit a larger fairness gap on tabular data compared to traditional models ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This highlights a gap in research on effectively achieving fairness for LLMs in tabular domains.\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper explicitly compares the fairness of LLMs with \"traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks,\" for tabular prediction tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The key finding is that the fairness metric gap in LLMs is \"still larger than that in traditional machine learning models\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This suggests that for tabular prediction, LLMs currently exacerbate biases compared to established methods, even after some mitigation efforts.\n## 8.

This implies an underlying ethical principle that AI systems used in such applications should be fair and not perpetuate societal biases.\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nA key challenge highlighted is that social biases are \"inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pre-training corpus\" ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. This inherent nature makes bias mitigation challenging, as demonstrated by the \"moderate effect\" of in-context learning and fine-tuning ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. The persistent larger fairness gap in LLMs compared to traditional models for tabular data represents a significant open research question ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. Future research is needed to develop more effective strategies for mitigating these inherent biases, particularly for downstream tasks like tabular prediction. This could involve exploring novel fairness-aware pre-training or adaptation techniques specifically designed for the unique challenges of applying LLMs to structured data. The challenge of scaling fairness efforts to increasingly large LLMs and datasets is implicitly present, as the paper demonstrates the difficulty in mitigating bias even with current LLMs and likely extends to larger models trained on even more extensive, potentially biased, data.\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that LLMs inherit social biases from their training data, significantly impacting fairness in tabular prediction tasks ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data']. While in-context learning and fine-tuning offer some mitigation, the fairness gap remains larger than in traditional models, indicating the inherent nature of bias within LLMs ['investigating_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_for_predictions_on_tabular_data'].

This widespread deployment across various applications, especially in high-stake domains using tabular data, raises significant concerns regarding fairness and the potential for perpetuating harmful social biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Addressing bias and fairness is critical due to the societal impact of these models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This paper investigates the sources and extent of social bias in LLMs when applied to tabular classification, their implications for fairness, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies compared to traditional machine learning models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 2.

The paper investigates the extent to which LLM classifications are influenced by these social biases and stereotypes ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper doesn't propose a formal taxonomy of biases but empirically demonstrates the presence of inherent social biases in LLMs applied to tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights that social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pretraining corpus, rather than solely from downstream task datasets ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests a fundamental challenge in addressing bias that goes beyond task-specific data.\n### 2.2 Definitions and Metrics of Fairness\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly uses fairness metrics by examining the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" when comparing LLMs to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While specific mathematical formulations of metrics like demographic parity or equalized odds are not explicitly provided in the abstract, the focus is on evaluating disparity in outcomes across subgroups ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper does not delve into the underlying ethical principles of fairness beyond the general notion of mitigating harmful social biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly critiques the current state by demonstrating that existing mitigation strategies like in-context learning and fine-tuning only have a \"moderate effect\" on reducing the fairness metric gap in LLMs for tabular tasks, and this gap remains larger than in traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This points to the practical difficulties in achieving fairness with current LLM-based approaches.\n## 3. LLM Fundamentals and Bias Propagation Pathways\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper describes LLMs as models capable of making classifications for tabular tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It emphasizes that LLMs inherit social biases from their pretraining corpus ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The core mechanism relevant to bias propagation highlighted is the inheritance of biases from large-scale training data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 4. Sources and Mechanisms of Bias Propagation in LLMs\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe primary source of bias propagation discussed is the pretraining corpus from which LLMs inherit social biases ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper's experiments investigate how these inherited biases influence classifications, particularly in the context of tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The mechanism involves the LLM drawing upon information (and associated biases) from its training data when making predictions, even for structured tabular input ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 4.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights that social biases are inherited from the LLMs' pretraining corpus ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This implies that biases are introduced during the initial large-scale data collection and potentially inadequate preprocessing of that data.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings suggest that even when applying LLMs to relatively structured tabular data, the biases from the vast and potentially uncurated pretraining data significantly impact outcomes ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This points to limitations in current data collection and preprocessing pipelines for LLMs regarding fairness.\n### 4.2 Model Architecture and Training Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper indicates that the \"social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves\" ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While not detailing specific architectural biases, this suggests that the model's internal representations and learned parameters reflect and potentially amplify the biases present in the training data.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper demonstrates that standard mitigation techniques like fine-tuning have only a \"moderate effect\" on reducing fairness gaps ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This implies that the bias is deeply embedded during the primary training phase, making it difficult to fully address through downstream model modifications alone.\n### 4.3 Post-training and Deployment Bias\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines in-context learning as a post-training approach and demonstrates that label-flipping of in-context examples can \"significantly reduce biases\" ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that while inherent biases exist, careful prompt design or in-context examples can influence the model's behavior at deployment time.\nCritique of Existing Work: While label-flipping shows promise in reducing bias, the paper also notes that in-context learning in general only has a \"moderate effect\" compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that current post-training methods might not fully eliminate the deep-seated biases.\n## 5. Evaluating Bias and Fairness: Methodologies and Benchmarks\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper evaluates bias and fairness by examining the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" on tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It compares the performance of LLMs to traditional ML models in terms of this fairness gap ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The evaluation methodology involves conducting experiments with LLMs and traditional models on tabular datasets and measuring fairness-related outcomes across different subgroups defined by sensitive attributes (though specific attributes are not detailed in the abstract) ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 5.1 Benchmark Datasets\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper uses tabular datasets for its experiments ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The abstract does not provide specific details about the names or characteristics of these benchmark datasets beyond their tabular nature.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The core experimental result is that the fairness metric gap between different subgroups in LLM classifications for tabular data is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings, derived from experiments on tabular data, highlight that existing benchmarks and methodologies might not fully capture the extent of bias in LLMs when applied to non-traditional NLP tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The direct comparison to traditional ML models on the same tasks serves as an implicit critique of the fairness performance of LLMs.\n### 5.2 Fairness Metrics and Methodologies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper implicitly uses fairness metrics to quantify the \"fairness metric gap between different subgroups\" ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While specific metrics are not named, the methodology involves measuring disparities in outcomes across groups ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The experiments show that the fairness metric gap is larger for LLMs compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The observed larger fairness gap in LLMs suggests that current evaluation methodologies and metrics, even when applied, reveal significant fairness issues compared to established methods ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 5.3 Challenges and Limitations in Evaluation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates a key challenge in evaluating LLM fairness: even with methods applied to measure fairness on a specific task (tabular classification), the models exhibit significant bias inherited from their pretraining ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests that task-specific fairness evaluation might not fully account for the pervasive nature of biases embedded during pretraining ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's results implicitly point to the limitations of current evaluation in fully capturing the depth and source of LLM bias, particularly the distinction between bias from pretraining data and bias from downstream task data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 6. Mitigation Strategies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper explores in-context learning and fine-tuning as mitigation strategies for addressing bias in LLMs for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It also investigates the effect of label-flipping in-context examples ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 6.1 Data-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper does not explicitly discuss data-centric mitigation techniques applied to the tabular datasets themselves. Its focus is more on how LLMs handle bias despite the input data.\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 6.2 Model-Centric Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper examines fine-tuning as a model-centric mitigation technique ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper shows that fine-tuning has a \"moderate effect\" on reducing the fairness metric gap ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The fairness gap remains larger than in traditional ML models even after fine-tuning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The finding that fine-tuning has only a moderate effect highlights the limitation of this model-centric approach in fully mitigating the biases inherited from the pretraining phase ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 6.3 Post-Processing Techniques\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates in-context learning and specifically label-flipping of in-context examples as a form of intervention during inference (which can be viewed as a post-processing-like technique acting on the input) ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The paper demonstrates that label-flipping of in-context examples can \"significantly reduce biases\" ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. However, in-context learning overall has only a moderate effect compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: While label-flipping shows promise, the overall moderate effect of in-context learning suggests that simple post-processing or input manipulation techniques may not be sufficient to overcome deep-seated inherent biases in LLMs ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 6.4 Challenges and Trade-offs in Mitigation\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper highlights that even with mitigation strategies like in-context learning and fine-tuning, the fairness metric gap in LLMs for tabular classification remains larger than in traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This points to a significant challenge: effectively mitigating the inherent biases deeply embedded during pretraining. The paper implies a trade-off where current mitigation methods are not as effective as traditional ML in achieving fairness on tabular tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nExperimental Results and Comparative Data: The key comparative data is the consistently larger fairness metric gap in LLMs compared to traditional ML models, even after applying mitigation strategies ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper's findings are a direct critique of the effectiveness of current LLM mitigation strategies in achieving comparable fairness levels to traditional methods, particularly for tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 7. Fairness in Specific LLM Applications: Case Studies\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThis paper focuses specifically on the application of LLMs for making classifications for tabular tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. It serves as a case study for understanding fairness implications in this domain.\n### 7.1 Fairness in Tabular Data Predictions\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper investigates the fairness of LLMs in tabular classification tasks, particularly focusing on whether and to what extent social biases influence these classifications and their consequential implications for fairness ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The key finding is that LLMs tend to inherit social biases which significantly impact their fairness in this context ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights the fairness-related risks of using LLMs for tabular data by demonstrating the persistence of bias despite mitigation efforts ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 7.2 Comparison with Traditional Machine Learning Models\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nA core component of the paper is the comparison of LLMs with traditional machine learning models (such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks) in terms of fairness for tabular classification ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper explicitly shows that the fairness metric gap between different subgroups in LLMs is larger than that observed in traditional ML models, even after applying mitigation strategies like in-context learning and fine-tuning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This finding directly critiques the current state of fairness in LLMs relative to established methods for tabular tasks.\n## 8. Fairness Standards, Ethical Guidelines, and Governance\n### 8.1 Proposed Standards and Guidelines\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nCritique of Existing Work:\n### 8.2 Ethical Frameworks and Principles\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper touches upon the ethical implication of using biased LLMs in high-stake applications involving tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The focus is on the practical manifestation of social biases and their impact on fairness outcomes.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper implicitly underscores the need for stronger ethical frameworks and principles for LLMs by revealing their significant bias in a sensitive application domain ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n### 8.3 Challenges and Approaches in Implementation and Governance\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper demonstrates a practical challenge in implementing fair LLMs for tabular data: despite mitigation attempts, they show larger fairness gaps than traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This suggests difficulties in deploying LLMs fairly in domains where traditional methods are already used.\nCritique of Existing Work: The paper highlights that current approaches to mitigating bias in LLMs may not be sufficient for responsible deployment in applications requiring high fairness standards ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 9. Comprehensive Challenges and Future Research Directions\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper identifies a significant challenge: social biases are inherent within LLMs and inherited from their pretraining corpus, and current mitigation strategies (in-context learning and fine-tuning) only have a moderate effect, leaving a larger fairness gap compared to traditional ML models ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This points to the difficulty in overcoming deeply embedded biases through downstream interventions ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper's findings suggest a need for research directions that address bias at the pretraining stage or develop more effective post-hoc methods specifically tailored to LLMs and their unique characteristics when applied to structured data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The challenge of scaling fairness efforts to ever-larger LLMs is implied by the finding that biases are inherent in the large pretraining corpora ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications'].\n## 10. Conclusion and Call to Action\nPaper bibkey: [confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications]\nDigest: \nThe paper concludes that LLMs inherit social biases from their training data, significantly impacting their fairness in tabular classification tasks ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. Key findings include the larger fairness metric gap in LLMs compared to traditional ML models, even with moderate effects from in-context learning and fine-tuning ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. This highlights that the biases are inherent and originate from the pretraining corpus ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. While label-flipping shows promise, the overall findings underscore the significant challenges in achieving fairness with current LLM approaches for tabular data ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']. The paper implicitly calls for a rethinking of how LLMs are developed and applied in sensitive domains, emphasizing the need for more effective bias mitigation strategies, particularly addressing the inherent biases from pretraining ['confronting_llms_with_traditional_ml_rethinking_the_fairness_of_large_language_models_in_tabular_classifications']."}], "papers": [{"title": "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey", "url": "https://github.com/i-gallegos/Fair-LLM-Benchmark", "txt": "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey\n> Isabel O.

To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets. However, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs. To address these limitations, we collect a variety of datasets designed for the bias evaluation of LLMs, and further propose CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Bechmark that covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks. The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By combining the three dimensions, we develop a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods.\nPrimary Area: datasets and benchmarks\nCode Of Ethics: I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.\nSubmission Guidelines: I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on the ICLR website.\nAnonymous Url: I certify that there is no URL that could be used to find authors’ identity.\nNo Acknowledgement Section: I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.\nSubmission Number: 11458\nLoading", "similarity": 98, "bibkey": "ceb_compositional_evaluation_benchmark_for_fairness_in_large_language_models"}, {"title": "Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs)", "url": "https://www.datacamp.com/blog/understanding-and-mitigating-bias-in-large-language-models-llms", "txt": "Dive into a comprehensive walk-through on understanding bias in LLMs, the impact it causes, and how to mitigate it to ensure trust and fairness.\nContents\n\nUnderstanding LLMs\n\nLLMs Use Cases\n\nThe Mechanism Behind LLMs\n\nThe Prediction and Language Generation Process in LLMs\n\nVersatility in Language Comprehension and Tasks\n\nThe Problem of Bias in LLMs\n\nIdentifying Bias\n\nImpacts of LLM Bias\n\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\n\nData curation\n\nModel fine-tuning\n\nMultiple methods and metrics for evaluation\n\nLogic in addressing LLM bias\n\nCase Studies and Real-World Applications\n\nGoogle BERT models diverse training data\n\nFairness indicator\n\nOpenAIs pre-training mitigations\n\nReducing Bias While Maintaining Performance\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you’ve been keeping up with the technology world, you’ll have heard the term ‘Large Language Models (LLMs)’ being thrown around. LLMs are currently the most popular tech term, and their significance in the artificial intelligence (AI) world is becoming greater by the day. LLMs continue to fuel the generative AI revolution as these models learn to process human languages, such as ChatGPT and Bard.\nLLMs have become a significant player in today's evolving market due to their ability to mirror human conversations through their in-depth natural language processing (NLP) systems. Naturally, everything has its limitations, and AI-powered assistants have their unique challenges.\nThis unique challenge is the potential for LLM bias, which is entrenched in the data used to train the models.\nUnderstanding LLMs\nLet’s take it a step back. What are LLMs?\nLLMs are AI systems such as ChatGPT, which are used to model and process human language. It is a type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to summarize, generate, and predict new content. The reason why they are called “large” is because the model requires millions or even billions of parameters, which are used to train the model using a ‘large’ corpus of text data.\nLLMs and NLP work hand in hand as they aim to possess a high understanding of the human language and its patterns and learn knowledge using large datasets.\nIf you are a newbie to the world of LLMs, the following article is recommended to get you up to speed:\nWhat is an LLM? A Guide on Large Language Models and How They Work. Or take our Large Language Models (LLMs) Concepts Course, which is also perfect for learning about LLMs.\nLLMs Use Cases\nLLMs have been widely used in different types of AI applications. They are becoming more popular by the day, and businesses are looking at different ways to integrate them into their current systems and tooling to improve workflow productivity.\nLLMs can be used for the following use cases:\nContent creation\nSentiment analysis\nCustomer service\nLanguage translation\nChatbots\nPersonalized marketing\nData analytics\nand more.\n\nThe Mechanism Behind LLMs\nThe Prediction and Language Generation Process in LLMs\nLLMs use Transformer models, a deep learning architecture that learns context and understands through sequential data analysis.\nTokenization is when input text is broken down into smaller units called tokens for the model to process and analyze through mathematical equations to discover the relationships between the different tokens. The mathematical process consists of adopting a probabilistic approach to predict the next sequence of words during the model's training phase.\n\nThe training phase consists of inputting the model with massive sets of text data to help the model understand various linguistic contexts, nuances, and styles. LLMs will create a knowledge base in which they can effectively mimic the human language.\nVersatility in Language Comprehension and Tasks\nThe versatility and language comprehension that LLMs possess is a testament to their advanced AI capability. Being trained on extensive datasets from various genres and styles, such as legal documents and fictional narratives, has provided LLMs with the ability to adapt to different scenarios and contexts.\nHowever, the versatility of LLMs goes beyond text prediction. Being able to handle tasks in different languages, different contexts, and different outputs is a type of versatility that is shown in a variety of adaptability applications such as customer service. This is thanks to the extensive training on large specific datasets and the fine-tuning process, which has enhanced its effectiveness in diverse fields.\nHowever, we must remember LLM's unique challenge: bias.\nThe Problem of Bias in LLMs\nAs we know, LLMs are trained on a variety of text data from various sources. When the data is inputted into the model, it uses this data as its sole knowledge base and interprets it as factual. However, the data may be ingrained with biases along with misinformation, which can lead to the LLM's outputs reflecting bias.\nA tool that is known to improve productivity and assist in day-to-day tasks is showing areas of ethical concern. You can learn more about the ethics of AI in our course.\nIdentifying Bias\nThe more data you have, the better. If the training data used for LLMs contain unrepresentative samples or biases, naturally, the model will inherit and learn these biases. Examples of LLM bias are gender, race, and cultural bias.\nFor example, LLMs can be biased towards genders if the majority of their data shows that women predominantly work as cleaners or nurses, and men are typically engineers or CEOs. The LLM has inherited society's stereotypes due to the training data being fed into it. Another example is racial bias, in which LLMs may reflect certain ethnic groups among stereotypes, as well as cultural bias of overrepresentation to fit the stereotype.\nThe two main origins of biases in LLMs are:\nData sources\nHuman evaluation\n\nAlthough LLMs are very versatile, this challenge shows how the model is less effective when it comes to multicultural content. The concern around LLMs and biases comes down to the use of LLMs in the decision-making process, naturally raising ethical concerns.\nImpacts of LLM Bias\nThe impacts of bias in LLMs affect both the users of the model and the wider society.\nReinforcement of stereotypes\n\nAs we touched on above, there are different types of stereotypes, such as culture and gender. Biases in the training data of LLMs continue to reinforce these harmful stereotypes, causing society to stay in the cycle of prejudice and effectively preventing progress in society.\nIf LLMs continue to digest biased data, they will continue to push cultural division and gender inequality.\nDiscrimination\n\nDiscrimination is the prejudicial treatment of different categories of people based on their sex, ethnicity, age, or disability. Training data can be heavily underrepresented, in which the data does not show a true representation of different groups.\nLLMs outputs that contain biased responses that continue to conserve and maintain racial, gender, and age discrimination aid the negative impact on people's daily lives from marginalized communities, such as the recruitment hiring process to opportunities for education. This leads to a lack of diversity and inclusivity in LLMs outputs, raising ethical concerns as these outputs can be further used for the decision-making process.\nMisinformation and disinformation\n\nIf there are concerns that the training data used for LLMs contain unrepresentative samples or biases, it also raises the question of whether the data contains the correct information. A spread of misinformation or disinformation through LLMs can have consequential effects.\nFor example, in the healthcare department, the use of LLMs that contain biased information can lead to dangerous health decisions. Another example is LLMs containing politically biased data and pushing this narrative that can lead to political disinformation.\nTrust\n\nThe ethical concerns around LLMs are not the main reason why some of society have not taken well to the implementation of AI systems in our everyday lives. Some or many people have concerns about the use of AI systems and how they will impact our society, for example, job loss and economic instability.\nThere is already a lack of trust when it comes to AI systems. Therefore, the bias produced by LLMs can completely diminish any trust or confidence that society has in AI systems overall. In order for LLM technology to be confidently accepted, society needs to trust it.\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\n\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\nData curation\nLet's start from the beginning, the data involved. Companies need to be highly responsible for the type of data that they input into models.\nEnsuring that the training data used for LLMs has been curated from a diverse range of data sources. Text datasets that have come from different demographics, languages, and cultures will balance the representation of the human language. This ensures that the training data does not contain unrepresentative samples and guides targeted model fine-tuning efforts, which can reduce the impact of bias when used by the wider community.\nModel fine-tuning\nOnce a range of data sources has been collated and inputted into the model, organizations can continue to improve accuracy and reduce biases through model fine-tuning. There are several fine-tuning approaches, such as:\nTransfer Learning: This process involves using a pre-trained model and training further on it using a smaller and more specific dataset to fine-tune the model output. For example, fine-tuning a model with legal documentation using a general text data pre-trained model.\nBias Reduction Techniques: Organizations should also go the extra mile and implement a bias detection tool into their process to be able to detect and mitigate biases found in the training data. Methods such as counterfactual data augmentation consist of altering the training data to break stereotypical data and reduce gender, racial, or cultural biases in the model.\n\nYou can learn more about the fine-tuning process with our Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 tutorial, which has a step-by-step guide to adjusting the pre-trained model.\nMultiple methods and metrics for evaluation\nIn order to continuously grow AI systems that can be safely integrated with today's society, organizations need to have multiple methods and metrics used in their evaluation process. Before AI systems such as LLMs are open to the wider community, the correct methods and metrics must be implemented to ensure that the different dimensions of bias are captured in LLM outputs.\nExamples of methods include human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or hybrid evaluation. All of these methods are used to either detect, estimate, or filter biases in LLMs. Examples of metrics include accuracy, sentiment, fairness, and more. These metrics can provide feedback on the bias in LLM outputs and help to continuously improve the biases detected in LLMs.\nIf you would like to learn more about the different evaluations used to improve LLM quality, check out our code-along on Evaluating LLM Responses.\nLogic in addressing LLM bias\nA study from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has made significant advancements in LLMs by integrating logical reasoning: Large language models are biased. Can logic help save them?\nThe importance of logical and structured thinking in LLMs allows the models to be able to process and generate outputs with the application of logical reasoning and critical thinking so that LLMs can provide more accurate responses using the reasoning behind them.\nThe process consists of building a neutral language model in which the relationships between tokens are considered ‘neutral’ as there is no logic stating that there is a relationship between the two. CSAIL trained this method on a language model and found the newly trained model was less biased without the need for more data and additional algorithm training.\nLogic-aware language models will have the ability to avoid producing harmful stereotypes.\nCase Studies and Real-World Applications\nGoogle BERT models diverse training data\nGoogle Research continues to improve its LLM BERT by expanding its training data to ensure that it is more inclusive and diverse. The use of large datasets that contain unannotated text for the pre-training phase has allowed the model to later be fine-tuned to adapt to specific tasks. The aim is to create an LLM that is less biased and produces more robust outputs. Google Research has stated that this method has shown a reduction in stereotypical outputs generated by the model and continues to improve its performance in understanding different dialects and cultural contexts.\nFairness indicator\nThe Google Research team has put together several tools called ‘Fairness Indicators,’ which aim to detect bias in machine learning models and go through a mitigating process. These indicators use metrics such as false positives and false negatives to evaluate performance and identify gaps that may be concealed by general metrics.\nOpenAIs pre-training mitigations\nOpenAI has ensured the wider community that safety, privacy, and ethical concerns are at the forefront of their goals. Their pre-training mitigations for DALL-E 2 included filtering out violent and sexual images from the training dataset, removing ​​images that are visually similar to one another, and then teaching the model to mitigate the effects of filtering the dataset.\nReducing Bias While Maintaining Performance\nBeing able to achieve one thing without sacrificing the other can be impossible at times. This applies when trying to achieve a balance between reducing LLM bias while being able to maintain or even improve the model's performance. Debiasing models are imperative to achieve fairness. However, the model's performance and accuracy should not be compromised.\nA strategic approach needs to be implemented to ensure that mitigation methods to reduce bias, such as data curation, model fine-tuning, and the use of multiple methods, do not affect the model's ability to understand and generate language outputs. Improvements need to be made; however, the model's performance should not be a trade-off.\nIt is a matter of trial and error, monitoring and adjustment, debiasing and improvement.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have covered:\nWhat LLMs are and the mechanism behind them\nThe problem with bias in LLMs and its impact\nHow to mitigate LLM bias\nAlong with real-world examples.\n\nLLM bias is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that needs to be prioritized for society to have more trust in it and freely accept its integration into everyday tasks. Organizations need to understand the lasting negative impact that stereotypes have on individuals and society and use this to ensure that the path to mitigating LLM biases through data curation, model fine-tuning, and logical modelling is established.\nTo learn more about LLMs, check out our Large Language Models Concepts course, which covers how these powerful tools are reshaping the AI landscape.\n\nAuthor\nNisha Arya Ahmed\nA keen learner, seeking to implement my technical data science and strong interpersonal skills, to improve and broaden my tech knowledge and writing skills.\nI transitioned into the world of Data Science from Pharmacology, taking a 9-month bootcamp with Lambda school.\nI am interested in implementing and improving my technical coding and writing skills in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\nCurrently, I am a Data Scientist and a Freelance Technical Writer.\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nNisha Arya AhmedTechnical Writer | Content Creator | Community Manager\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nWhat is an LLM?

This has become amplified with the rise of large language models. This article explores how to assess and mitigate this bias to allow for fairer systems.\nBias in AISs (Artificial Intelligence Systems) can lead to incorrect decisions or even discrimination that negatively affects individuals and social groups. For example, a recent study reveals that job descriptions created by generative AI convey far more stereotypes than those written by people. Therefore, job descriptions written by GPT-4o contain more bias than the work of a human. These concerns are becoming critical as LLMs (Large Language Models) become exponentially more popular. LLMs, which are used in various fields ranging from virtual assistance to content generation, are increasingly integrated into large-scale applications such as search engines or office suites. This massive adoption by users and businesses underlines the need to understand and manage bias to ensure fair and accountable systems. According to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report, the number of scientific papers on fairness and bias has increased by 25% since 2022.\n\nLLM bias can appear within the model’s internal representations as well as in final decisions. Bias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training.\n\n## Regulatory issues\n\nAt the same time, the European Union regulation on artificial intelligence (**AI Act**), which came into force on 1 August 2024 and will begin to apply gradually, aims to regulate the development, marketing and use of AISs. The Act classifies AISs according to their risks, ranging from unacceptable risk to minimal risk. By way of example, any AI-based social scoring system is prohibited, an AIS that assists with recruitment or training tasks is classified as high risk and subject to additional requirements, and limited-risk chatbots are subject only to transparency obligations. “Appropriate” measures must be put in place for high-risk systems **to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases** **in the data sets** used to train the models**.** These obligations are particularly important if the biases in question are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations. This means that a high-risk AIS, such as a recruitment or training assistance tool, is subject to these strict bias management requirements. In this article, we will take a closer look at managing LLM bias.\n\n## What is an LLM?\n\nAn LM (Language Model) is a **statistical model designed to represent natural language**. LLMs are advanced versions of these models, trained on vast data sets and using sophisticated architectures. **Their ability to understand and generate text in a coherent and contextually relevant way is revolutionising NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications, improving the performance of machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis and human-machine interaction systems.**\n\n## What is bias?\n\nA bias can be defined as a **deviation from the norm.** In the field of AI, four broad families of norms have been identified and thus four types of bias: **statistical bias**(e.g. taking an average that simplifies the phenomenon in question),**methodological bias**(e.g. using a device that is not accurate enough to measure the phenomenon in question or using an LLM that has been trained on data sets that are not current), **cognitive bias** (e.g. making a subjective and irrational decision) and **socio-historical bias** (e.g. training an LLM on data sets from a single country and then using it in other countries with different worldviews).\n\n## LLMs are biased\n\nBias in AISs arises from the data sets used to train the model, from the architecture choices and from inappropriate usage. In LLMs, the huge scale of the pre-training data sets, the adaptation process (aligning with human values, specialising in a particular language or field etc.), the bias mitigation choice and the nature of the **Prompt** (e.g. what kind of roleplay) can cause harms of allocation (unjust distribution of resources) or of representation (reinforcement of stereotypes). Whereas harms of allocation produce immediate, easy-to-formalise effects, harms of representation produce long-term effects and are more difficult to formalise.\nThe development pipeline of **Generative LLMs** is built mainly from **two blocks: a basic model**, developed to encode the language and its rules, **and a second model, which is fine-tuned to respond to specific instructions** (e.g. open questions/answers). This second model can then be further tailored to the desired task (e.g. customer relations chatbot) and/or aligned with stated values (e.g. adherence to a company’s ethical charter).\nThe pipeline of a generative LLM is as follows:\n\nThe biases in LLMs can therefore manifest both in the model itself (**intrinsic bias, which occurs in the model’s internal representations**) and in the final decisions it takes (**extrinsic bias, which occurs in final decisions and predictions).**\n\n## How to evaluate bias in LLMs\n\nBias in LLMs can be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically. **Intrinsic methods** include analysing relationships between words in the model’s internal representations or observing differences in how the model assigns probabilities to words. **Extrinsic methods**, meanwhile, focus on how the model performs at specific tasks. There are **evaluation metrics** specific to traditional NLP tasks that aim to measure the quality of LLMs on reference data sets or generated text. In addition, **benchmarks** (comprising a test data set and NLP task-specific evaluation metrics) can be used to measure the quality and effectiveness of models on specific tasks such as machine translation, text generation etc. However, the test data sets used in the benchmarks can bring their own biases. The suitability of the benchmarks used is therefore a key issue when evaluating LLMs.\n\n## Mitigating bias\n\nBias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training.\n  * **Additional training** may entail supervised or semi-supervised **fine-tuning** or methods to **align the models with expected values** (via reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics). These methods make it possible to adjust models to reduce bias while maintaining their performance, but they are resource-intensive and can introduce new opinions, or new representations, and therefore new biases that are consubstantial with the new data added for these mitigation techniques.\n  * **In the absence of additional training**, techniques such as **post-generation self-diagnosis**[1] **or prompt engineering** can be used. These techniques, which do not require additional training, are simpler and require less expertise. They are therefore easier to implement. Post-generation self-diagnosis entails designing specific instructions to steer the model towards generating fairer and less biased responses. This is based on the model’s ability to evaluate its own outputs after generating them. **Carefully formulated prompts**, meanwhile, can force the model to adopt varied perspectives and avoid stereotypes. **Prompt engineering with roleplay**, where the respondent’s profile is specified (e.g. gender, education level), is also an effective method for revealing and mitigating certain biases. For example, by asking the model to answer a question as if it were an expert or a person from a specific social group, the bias implicit in the generated responses can be identified and corrected.\n\nVigilance and compromise are sometimes necessary to ensure that bias-mitigation actions do not harm the model’s performance.\n\n## Corporate action plan\n\nAll the above **must be combined with appropriate governance,** including establishing guidelines for managing bias, appointing ethics officers and managers responsible for training employees, and implementing active monitoring and development of technical tools. It is vital that the members of the teams involved in developing AISs are diverse.\n**Furthermore, several actions must be carried out** on a case-by-case basis, depending on the use case, the deployment context and the people involved**.**\n**First,** it is necessary to**choose the fairness criteria and**[**metrics**] and then to identify the NLP task underlying the use case and the known biases**. Then**,**different LLMs should be compared using an existing**[**benchmark**] or developing one ad hoc. Developing a benchmark requires collecting data, annotating it if necessary, defining the task and establishing how to measure that the task has been performed well on the body of data in question (evaluation metrics). **Then** it is a question of**selecting the least biased (and sufficiently powerful) model** by comparing the results of different models on the benchmark used. **The last step** uses prompt engineering to compare the results obtained on the benchmark with different prompts **in an attempt to optimise the prompt**, in accordance with the chosen fairness criteria. It should be noted that model performance may vary according to the parameters of the prompt (temperature[2], instruction[3], context[4], whether or not examples are provided[5] and system prompt[6]) and the role taken in the prompt. Testing and adjusting models according to specific use cases is therefore essential.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, managing LLM bias remains a **complex and evolving subject**. Although there are ways to evaluate (intrinsic and extrinsic methods, existing or new benchmark) and mitigate bias (with or without additional training), the area is not yet fully mature. **Within companies,** the focus is currently on **organisation,** **developing prototypes and experimenting**. Developing fair and accountable LLMs will undoubtedly help with their large-scale adoption.\n[1] This technique is based on the model’s ability to evaluate its own outputs after generating them. The model uses predefined criteria to evaluate the quality and fairness of the generated output (e.g. give me the answer and tell me if it is biased). These criteria may include measures of bias, stereotyping or toxicity. If the initial output is deemed to be biased or inappropriate, the model can either adjust the output in real time or generate a new response that takes the evaluation criteria into account. The revised output is then validated to ensure that it meets the fairness and quality criteria before being presented to the user.\n[2] Adjusting the temperature of the model allows you to control the creativity and diversity of the responses generated. Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the probability of selecting subsequent words in a sequence. A low temperature (close to 0) makes the model more deterministic, while a high temperature (close to 1) increases the diversity of responses.\n[3] Instructions provide clear guidance on the task to be performed. They should be written concisely and accurately to minimise ambiguity and guide the model towards a specific response.\n[4] Context can be added to the prompt to provide general information that makes the instruction easier to understand. The context should be positioned at the beginning of the prompt in order to place the model in a specific framework and guide its responses.\n[5] Providing one or more examples of the expected prediction can help the model understand the task. The example must be representative of the task and be positioned at the end of the prompt to maximise its impact.\n[6] This involves adding guidelines to limit model responses to a specific format, thereby reducing noise and irrelevant responses.\n## Read more :\n\n### Lexicon\nLexicon\nLexicon\n**NLP (Natural Language Processing)**\nAn area of artificial intelligence that focuses on how machines understand and manipulate human language.

However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities present in society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data in many high-stake applications, it is important to explore the following questions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making classifications for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM classifications for tabular data influenced by social biases and stereotypes; and what are the consequential implications for fairness?Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular classification tasks. Furthermore, our investigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context learning and finetuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation emphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pretraining corpus, not only from the downstream task datasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent bias within LLMs.\nAnthology ID:\n    2024.naacl-long.198\nVolume:\n    Proceedings of the 2024 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (Volume 1: Long Papers)\nMonth:\n    June\nYear:\n    2024\nAddress:\n    Mexico City, Mexico\nEditors:\n    Kevin Duh, Helena Gomez, Steven Bethard\nVenue:\n    NAACL\nSIG:\nPublisher:\n    Association for Computational Linguistics\nNote:\nPages:\n    3603–3620\nLanguage:\nDOI:\n    10.18653/v1/2024.naacl-long.198 To the current version of the paper by DOI\nBibkey:\n    liu-etal-2024-confronting\nCite (ACL):\n    Yanchen Liu, Srishti Gautam, Jiaqi Ma, and Himabindu Lakkaraju. 2024.

The impact of generative AI is predicted to be significant, offering efficiency and productivity enhancements across industries. However, as we enter a new phase in the technology's lifecycle, it's crucial to understand its limitations before fully integrating it into corporate tech stacks.\n\nLarge language model (LLM) generative AI, a powerful tool for content creation, holds transformative potential. But beneath its capabilities lies a critical concern: the potential biases ingrained within these AI systems. Addressing these biases is paramount to the responsible and equitable implementation of LLM-based technologies.\n\nRecognizing The Biases\n\nPrudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases. Here are several biases that can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems.\n\nMachine bias refers to the biases that are present in the training data used to build LLMs. Since these models learn from vast human-generated datasets, they tend to absorb the biases present in the text, perpetuating stereotypes and discriminations. Biases pertaining to race, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status can inadvertently be perpetuated by the AI system, leading to biased outputs.\n\nAvailability bias stems from the fact that LLM generative AI models are exposed to large amounts of publicly available data. As a result, the model is more likely to favor content that is more readily available while neglecting perspectives and information that are less prevalent online.\n\nThe availability bias in an LLM can create information bubbles and echo chambers that simply reinforce existing biases rather than fostering diverse perspectives. It can also lead to misinformation on a given topic if that misinformation is more readily available than factual content. This phenomenon can exacerbate social divisions and undermine the objective and balanced dissemination of knowledge.\n\nConfirmation bias is a psychological tendency in which individuals seek information that confirms their existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that challenges them. This can be demonstrated either in the training data or in the way that the prompt is written to which the generative AI will develop a response.\n\nWhen users seek information on a particular subject, the AI might selectively generate content that reinforces their viewpoints, leading to a reinforcement loop where users only encounter information that confirms their existing biases.\n\nSelection bias emerges when the training data is not representative of the entire population or target audience. If certain groups or perspectives are underrepresented or excluded from the training data, the AI model will lack the necessary knowledge to generate unbiased and comprehensive content.\n\nFor example, if the training data primarily comprises data from Western countries, the AI may struggle to produce accurate and culturally relevant content for non-Western audiences. This omission perpetuates societal inequalities and prevents the AI system from being an inclusive and unbiased information source.\n\nGroup attribution bias emerges when the generative AI attributes specific characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on the actions of a few individuals. For example, the AI might associate negative attributes with specific ethnicities or genders, perpetuating harmful generalizations and prejudices. To avoid this, LLM models must be trained on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups.\n\nContextual bias arises when the LLM model struggles to understand or interpret the context of a conversation or prompt accurately. Misunderstanding the context can lead to the generation of inappropriate or misleading responses. Data scientists need to fine-tune the model and carefully curate their prompts to better comprehend the context and avoid generating content that is contextually inappropriate or biased.\n\nLinguistic bias occurs when the LLM generative AI favors certain linguistic styles, vocabularies or cultural references over others. This can result in the AI generating content that is more relatable to certain language groups or cultures while alienating others. Data scientists should work to ensure that the AI model remains linguistically neutral and adapts to various language styles and cultural nuances.\n\nAnchoring bias occurs when an AI model relies too heavily on the initial information it receives. This could lead to the model incorporating early biases present in the training data and perpetuating them throughout its generated content. Data scientists must carefully curate the initial information provided to the model and continuously monitor its outputs to prevent this bias from taking hold.\n\nAutomation bias refers to the tendency of humans to blindly trust AI-generated outputs without critically evaluating them. This is one of the most concerning biases when discussing generative AI, as it causes individuals to place unwarranted trust in AI systems, assuming they are infallible.\n\nWhen relying on LLM generative AI for professional use, it is crucial for data scientists and users to exercise skepticism and independently verify the generated content to avoid propagating false or biased information. Blindly accepting AI-generated content without scrutiny can lead to the dissemination of false or biased information, further amplifying existing biases in society.\n\nMy doctoral study on big data governance provides some guidance for data scientists and technology leaders wanting to harness generative AI from LLMs. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing robust governance mechanisms for big data, which serves as the foundation for these LLM and generative AI models. By creating transparent guidelines for data collection, data scientists can actively identify and minimize biases in the training data.\n\nConclusion\n\nLLM generative AI offers transformative potential across industries, yet biases pose significant risks. Adhering to ethical AI development principles is paramount. Biases built into the models can affect content generation, emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, robust governance and vigilant evaluation.\n\nTo address these biases, data scientists must curate inclusive and representative training datasets, implement robust governance mechanisms and continuously monitor and audit the AI-generated outputs. Responsible AI deployment safeguards against biases and unlocks AI's true potential in shaping a fair and unbiased technological future.\n\nAs we continue to harness the power of AI, it is essential to exercise caution, promote transparency and strive for fairness to unlock the true potential of these transformative technologies.", "similarity": 95, "bibkey": "navigating_the_biases_in_llm_generative_ai_a_guide_to_responsible_implementation"}, {"title": "Fairness standards for large language models", "url": "https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/fairness-standards-for-large-language-models/", "txt": "Fairness standards for large language models\n\nProject Contents\n\nOverview\n\nKey Information\n\nParticipants\n\nOverview\n\nLate 2022 and early 2023 saw breakthroughs in the commercialisation of large language models (LLMs), advanced AI systems designed for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation.

Wang and Redelmeier’s study reveals that LLMs are prone to biases, raising important questions about their role in medical decision-making. To prevent errors in decision-making with LLMs, it is recommended that clinicians aim to critically engage with LLMs (e.g. refuting their hypotheses rather than looking for confirmation) researchers should focus on identifying and evaluating collaborative strategies between AI and human decision-making. Furthermore, research on context-specific implementation is important. We need to ensure that AI complements, rather than replicates, human cognitive processes.

These tools, which power applications like chatbots, translation services, and content generation, can transform industries. But they also pose significant challenges. Let’s explore how Bias manifests in LLMs and what fairness means.\nWhat is Bias and Fairness in LLMs?\nBias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that a model might make regarding its predictions that unfairly favour one group and disadvantage another. In Machine Learning, this Bias usually comes through the data used to develop models, the design of algorithms, or the interpretations of the outputs. The biased dataset that reflects stereotypes may make the LLM reproduce the stereotype in its responses.\nFairness in AI is about having the system treat all users equally and avoiding the perpetuation of societal inequities. In other words, models need to be designed with respect for diversity and deliver good results regardless of the user's background.\nHow does Bias Arise in LLMs?\nLLMs, like GPT or any other tool, are trained on massive datasets drawn from the internet, books, and other digital repositories. Such datasets often contain historical, cultural, and societal biases. Below are some of the key areas in which bias creeps into LLMs:\nData Bias : The training data may overrepresent or underrepresent certain groups, thereby leading to skewed outputs. For instance, if a dataset consists of predominantly Western-centric texts, the model may end up generating responses that favour Western perspectives.\nRead More\nCOMMENTS(0)\nComment\nRich Text
