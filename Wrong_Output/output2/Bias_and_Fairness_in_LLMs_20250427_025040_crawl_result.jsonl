Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, defining distinct facets of harm and introducing several desiderata to operationalize fairness for LLMs. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies, two for bias evaluation, namely metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation disambiguates the relationship between metrics and evaluation datasets, and organizes metrics by the different levels at which they operate in a model: embeddings, probabilities, and generated text. Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or prompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a consolidation of publicly-available datasets for improved access. Our third taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their intervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing, with granular subcategories that elucidate research trends. Finally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work. Synthesizing a wide range of recent research, we aim to provide a clear guide of the existing literature that empowers researchers and practitioners to better understand and prevent the propagation of bias in LLMs.\nComments: | Accepted at Computational Linguistics, Volume 50, Number 3\n---|---\nSubjects: | Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Machine Learning (cs.LG)\nCite as: | arXiv:2309.00770 [cs.CL]\n(or arXiv:2309.00770v3 [cs.CL] for this version)\nFocus to learn more arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\nSubmission history\nFrom: Isabel Gallegos [[view email]] [[v1]] Sat, 2 Sep 2023 00:32:55 UTC (810 KB) [[v2]] Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:50:00 UTC (826 KB) [v3] Fri, 12 Jul 2024 20:29:57 UTC (846 KB)\nFull-text links:\nAccess Paper:\nView a PDF of the paper titled Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey, by Isabel O.

To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets. However, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs. To address these limitations, we collect a variety of datasets designed for the bias evaluation of LLMs, and further propose CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Bechmark that covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks. The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By combining the three dimensions, we develop a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods.\nPrimary Area: datasets and benchmarks\nCode Of Ethics: I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.\nSubmission Guidelines: I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on the ICLR website.\nAnonymous Url: I certify that there is no URL that could be used to find authors’ identity.\nNo Acknowledgement Section: I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.\nSubmission Number: 11458\nLoading", "similarity": 98}, {"title": "Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs)", "url": "https://www.datacamp.com/blog/understanding-and-mitigating-bias-in-large-language-models-llms", "txt": "Dive into a comprehensive walk-through on understanding bias in LLMs, the impact it causes, and how to mitigate it to ensure trust and fairness.\nContents\n\nUnderstanding LLMs\n\nLLMs Use Cases\n\nThe Mechanism Behind LLMs\n\nThe Prediction and Language Generation Process in LLMs\n\nVersatility in Language Comprehension and Tasks\n\nThe Problem of Bias in LLMs\n\nIdentifying Bias\n\nImpacts of LLM Bias\n\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\n\nData curation\n\nModel fine-tuning\n\nMultiple methods and metrics for evaluation\n\nLogic in addressing LLM bias\n\nCase Studies and Real-World Applications\n\nGoogle BERT models diverse training data\n\nFairness indicator\n\nOpenAIs pre-training mitigations\n\nReducing Bias While Maintaining Performance\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you’ve been keeping up with the technology world, you’ll have heard the term ‘Large Language Models (LLMs)’ being thrown around. LLMs are currently the most popular tech term, and their significance in the artificial intelligence (AI) world is becoming greater by the day. LLMs continue to fuel the generative AI revolution as these models learn to process human languages, such as ChatGPT and Bard.\nLLMs have become a significant player in today's evolving market due to their ability to mirror human conversations through their in-depth natural language processing (NLP) systems. Naturally, everything has its limitations, and AI-powered assistants have their unique challenges.\nThis unique challenge is the potential for LLM bias, which is entrenched in the data used to train the models.\nUnderstanding LLMs\nLet’s take it a step back. What are LLMs?\nLLMs are AI systems such as ChatGPT, which are used to model and process human language. It is a type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to summarize, generate, and predict new content. The reason why they are called “large” is because the model requires millions or even billions of parameters, which are used to train the model using a ‘large’ corpus of text data.\nLLMs and NLP work hand in hand as they aim to possess a high understanding of the human language and its patterns and learn knowledge using large datasets.\nIf you are a newbie to the world of LLMs, the following article is recommended to get you up to speed:\nWhat is an LLM? A Guide on Large Language Models and How They Work. Or take our Large Language Models (LLMs) Concepts Course, which is also perfect for learning about LLMs.\nLLMs Use Cases\nLLMs have been widely used in different types of AI applications. They are becoming more popular by the day, and businesses are looking at different ways to integrate them into their current systems and tooling to improve workflow productivity.\nLLMs can be used for the following use cases:\nContent creation\nSentiment analysis\nCustomer service\nLanguage translation\nChatbots\nPersonalized marketing\nData analytics\nand more.\n\nThe Mechanism Behind LLMs\nThe Prediction and Language Generation Process in LLMs\nLLMs use Transformer models, a deep learning architecture that learns context and understands through sequential data analysis.\nTokenization is when input text is broken down into smaller units called tokens for the model to process and analyze through mathematical equations to discover the relationships between the different tokens. The mathematical process consists of adopting a probabilistic approach to predict the next sequence of words during the model's training phase.\n\nThe training phase consists of inputting the model with massive sets of text data to help the model understand various linguistic contexts, nuances, and styles. LLMs will create a knowledge base in which they can effectively mimic the human language.\nVersatility in Language Comprehension and Tasks\nThe versatility and language comprehension that LLMs possess is a testament to their advanced AI capability. Being trained on extensive datasets from various genres and styles, such as legal documents and fictional narratives, has provided LLMs with the ability to adapt to different scenarios and contexts.\nHowever, the versatility of LLMs goes beyond text prediction. Being able to handle tasks in different languages, different contexts, and different outputs is a type of versatility that is shown in a variety of adaptability applications such as customer service. This is thanks to the extensive training on large specific datasets and the fine-tuning process, which has enhanced its effectiveness in diverse fields.\nHowever, we must remember LLM's unique challenge: bias.\nThe Problem of Bias in LLMs\nAs we know, LLMs are trained on a variety of text data from various sources. When the data is inputted into the model, it uses this data as its sole knowledge base and interprets it as factual. However, the data may be ingrained with biases along with misinformation, which can lead to the LLM's outputs reflecting bias.\nA tool that is known to improve productivity and assist in day-to-day tasks is showing areas of ethical concern. You can learn more about the ethics of AI in our course.\nIdentifying Bias\nThe more data you have, the better. If the training data used for LLMs contain unrepresentative samples or biases, naturally, the model will inherit and learn these biases. Examples of LLM bias are gender, race, and cultural bias.\nFor example, LLMs can be biased towards genders if the majority of their data shows that women predominantly work as cleaners or nurses, and men are typically engineers or CEOs. The LLM has inherited society's stereotypes due to the training data being fed into it. Another example is racial bias, in which LLMs may reflect certain ethnic groups among stereotypes, as well as cultural bias of overrepresentation to fit the stereotype.\nThe two main origins of biases in LLMs are:\nData sources\nHuman evaluation\n\nAlthough LLMs are very versatile, this challenge shows how the model is less effective when it comes to multicultural content. The concern around LLMs and biases comes down to the use of LLMs in the decision-making process, naturally raising ethical concerns.\nImpacts of LLM Bias\nThe impacts of bias in LLMs affect both the users of the model and the wider society.\nReinforcement of stereotypes\n\nAs we touched on above, there are different types of stereotypes, such as culture and gender. Biases in the training data of LLMs continue to reinforce these harmful stereotypes, causing society to stay in the cycle of prejudice and effectively preventing progress in society.\nIf LLMs continue to digest biased data, they will continue to push cultural division and gender inequality.\nDiscrimination\n\nDiscrimination is the prejudicial treatment of different categories of people based on their sex, ethnicity, age, or disability. Training data can be heavily underrepresented, in which the data does not show a true representation of different groups.\nLLMs outputs that contain biased responses that continue to conserve and maintain racial, gender, and age discrimination aid the negative impact on people's daily lives from marginalized communities, such as the recruitment hiring process to opportunities for education. This leads to a lack of diversity and inclusivity in LLMs outputs, raising ethical concerns as these outputs can be further used for the decision-making process.\nMisinformation and disinformation\n\nIf there are concerns that the training data used for LLMs contain unrepresentative samples or biases, it also raises the question of whether the data contains the correct information. A spread of misinformation or disinformation through LLMs can have consequential effects.\nFor example, in the healthcare department, the use of LLMs that contain biased information can lead to dangerous health decisions. Another example is LLMs containing politically biased data and pushing this narrative that can lead to political disinformation.\nTrust\n\nThe ethical concerns around LLMs are not the main reason why some of society have not taken well to the implementation of AI systems in our everyday lives. Some or many people have concerns about the use of AI systems and how they will impact our society, for example, job loss and economic instability.\nThere is already a lack of trust when it comes to AI systems. Therefore, the bias produced by LLMs can completely diminish any trust or confidence that society has in AI systems overall. In order for LLM technology to be confidently accepted, society needs to trust it.\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\n\nStrategies for Mitigating LLM Bias\nData curation\nLet's start from the beginning, the data involved. Companies need to be highly responsible for the type of data that they input into models.\nEnsuring that the training data used for LLMs has been curated from a diverse range of data sources. Text datasets that have come from different demographics, languages, and cultures will balance the representation of the human language. This ensures that the training data does not contain unrepresentative samples and guides targeted model fine-tuning efforts, which can reduce the impact of bias when used by the wider community.\nModel fine-tuning\nOnce a range of data sources has been collated and inputted into the model, organizations can continue to improve accuracy and reduce biases through model fine-tuning. There are several fine-tuning approaches, such as:\nTransfer Learning: This process involves using a pre-trained model and training further on it using a smaller and more specific dataset to fine-tune the model output. For example, fine-tuning a model with legal documentation using a general text data pre-trained model.\nBias Reduction Techniques: Organizations should also go the extra mile and implement a bias detection tool into their process to be able to detect and mitigate biases found in the training data. Methods such as counterfactual data augmentation consist of altering the training data to break stereotypical data and reduce gender, racial, or cultural biases in the model.\n\nYou can learn more about the fine-tuning process with our Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 tutorial, which has a step-by-step guide to adjusting the pre-trained model.\nMultiple methods and metrics for evaluation\nIn order to continuously grow AI systems that can be safely integrated with today's society, organizations need to have multiple methods and metrics used in their evaluation process. Before AI systems such as LLMs are open to the wider community, the correct methods and metrics must be implemented to ensure that the different dimensions of bias are captured in LLM outputs.\nExamples of methods include human evaluation, automatic evaluation, or hybrid evaluation. All of these methods are used to either detect, estimate, or filter biases in LLMs. Examples of metrics include accuracy, sentiment, fairness, and more. These metrics can provide feedback on the bias in LLM outputs and help to continuously improve the biases detected in LLMs.\nIf you would like to learn more about the different evaluations used to improve LLM quality, check out our code-along on Evaluating LLM Responses.\nLogic in addressing LLM bias\nA study from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has made significant advancements in LLMs by integrating logical reasoning: Large language models are biased. Can logic help save them?\nThe importance of logical and structured thinking in LLMs allows the models to be able to process and generate outputs with the application of logical reasoning and critical thinking so that LLMs can provide more accurate responses using the reasoning behind them.\nThe process consists of building a neutral language model in which the relationships between tokens are considered ‘neutral’ as there is no logic stating that there is a relationship between the two. CSAIL trained this method on a language model and found the newly trained model was less biased without the need for more data and additional algorithm training.\nLogic-aware language models will have the ability to avoid producing harmful stereotypes.\nCase Studies and Real-World Applications\nGoogle BERT models diverse training data\nGoogle Research continues to improve its LLM BERT by expanding its training data to ensure that it is more inclusive and diverse. The use of large datasets that contain unannotated text for the pre-training phase has allowed the model to later be fine-tuned to adapt to specific tasks. The aim is to create an LLM that is less biased and produces more robust outputs. Google Research has stated that this method has shown a reduction in stereotypical outputs generated by the model and continues to improve its performance in understanding different dialects and cultural contexts.\nFairness indicator\nThe Google Research team has put together several tools called ‘Fairness Indicators,’ which aim to detect bias in machine learning models and go through a mitigating process. These indicators use metrics such as false positives and false negatives to evaluate performance and identify gaps that may be concealed by general metrics.\nOpenAIs pre-training mitigations\nOpenAI has ensured the wider community that safety, privacy, and ethical concerns are at the forefront of their goals. Their pre-training mitigations for DALL-E 2 included filtering out violent and sexual images from the training dataset, removing ​​images that are visually similar to one another, and then teaching the model to mitigate the effects of filtering the dataset.\nReducing Bias While Maintaining Performance\nBeing able to achieve one thing without sacrificing the other can be impossible at times. This applies when trying to achieve a balance between reducing LLM bias while being able to maintain or even improve the model's performance. Debiasing models are imperative to achieve fairness. However, the model's performance and accuracy should not be compromised.\nA strategic approach needs to be implemented to ensure that mitigation methods to reduce bias, such as data curation, model fine-tuning, and the use of multiple methods, do not affect the model's ability to understand and generate language outputs. Improvements need to be made; however, the model's performance should not be a trade-off.\nIt is a matter of trial and error, monitoring and adjustment, debiasing and improvement.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we have covered:\nWhat LLMs are and the mechanism behind them\nThe problem with bias in LLMs and its impact\nHow to mitigate LLM bias\nAlong with real-world examples.\n\nLLM bias is a complex and multi-faceted challenge that needs to be prioritized for society to have more trust in it and freely accept its integration into everyday tasks. Organizations need to understand the lasting negative impact that stereotypes have on individuals and society and use this to ensure that the path to mitigating LLM biases through data curation, model fine-tuning, and logical modelling is established.\nTo learn more about LLMs, check out our Large Language Models Concepts course, which covers how these powerful tools are reshaping the AI landscape.\n\nAuthor\nNisha Arya Ahmed\nA keen learner, seeking to implement my technical data science and strong interpersonal skills, to improve and broaden my tech knowledge and writing skills.\nI transitioned into the world of Data Science from Pharmacology, taking a 9-month bootcamp with Lambda school.\nI am interested in implementing and improving my technical coding and writing skills in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.\nCurrently, I am a Data Scientist and a Freelance Technical Writer.\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nNisha Arya AhmedTechnical Writer | Content Creator | Community Manager\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nWhat is an LLM?

This has become amplified with the rise of large language models. This article explores how to assess and mitigate this bias to allow for fairer systems.\nBias in AISs (Artificial Intelligence Systems) can lead to incorrect decisions or even discrimination that negatively affects individuals and social groups. For example, a recent study reveals that job descriptions created by generative AI convey far more stereotypes than those written by people. Therefore, job descriptions written by GPT-4o contain more bias than the work of a human. These concerns are becoming critical as LLMs (Large Language Models) become exponentially more popular. LLMs, which are used in various fields ranging from virtual assistance to content generation, are increasingly integrated into large-scale applications such as search engines or office suites. This massive adoption by users and businesses underlines the need to understand and manage bias to ensure fair and accountable systems. According to the Stanford 2024 AI Index Report, the number of scientific papers on fairness and bias has increased by 25% since 2022.\n\nLLM bias can appear within the model’s internal representations as well as in final decisions. Bias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training.\n\n## Regulatory issues\n\nAt the same time, the European Union regulation on artificial intelligence (**AI Act**), which came into force on 1 August 2024 and will begin to apply gradually, aims to regulate the development, marketing and use of AISs. The Act classifies AISs according to their risks, ranging from unacceptable risk to minimal risk. By way of example, any AI-based social scoring system is prohibited, an AIS that assists with recruitment or training tasks is classified as high risk and subject to additional requirements, and limited-risk chatbots are subject only to transparency obligations. “Appropriate” measures must be put in place for high-risk systems **to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases** **in the data sets** used to train the models**.** These obligations are particularly important if the biases in question are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations. This means that a high-risk AIS, such as a recruitment or training assistance tool, is subject to these strict bias management requirements. In this article, we will take a closer look at managing LLM bias.\n\n## What is an LLM?\n\nAn LM (Language Model) is a **statistical model designed to represent natural language**. LLMs are advanced versions of these models, trained on vast data sets and using sophisticated architectures. **Their ability to understand and generate text in a coherent and contextually relevant way is revolutionising NLP (Natural Language Processing) applications, improving the performance of machine translation, text generation, sentiment analysis and human-machine interaction systems.**\n\n## What is bias?\n\nA bias can be defined as a **deviation from the norm.** In the field of AI, four broad families of norms have been identified and thus four types of bias: **statistical bias**(e.g. taking an average that simplifies the phenomenon in question),**methodological bias**(e.g. using a device that is not accurate enough to measure the phenomenon in question or using an LLM that has been trained on data sets that are not current), **cognitive bias** (e.g. making a subjective and irrational decision) and **socio-historical bias** (e.g. training an LLM on data sets from a single country and then using it in other countries with different worldviews).\n\n## LLMs are biased\n\nBias in AISs arises from the data sets used to train the model, from the architecture choices and from inappropriate usage. In LLMs, the huge scale of the pre-training data sets, the adaptation process (aligning with human values, specialising in a particular language or field etc.), the bias mitigation choice and the nature of the **Prompt** (e.g. what kind of roleplay) can cause harms of allocation (unjust distribution of resources) or of representation (reinforcement of stereotypes). Whereas harms of allocation produce immediate, easy-to-formalise effects, harms of representation produce long-term effects and are more difficult to formalise.\nThe development pipeline of **Generative LLMs** is built mainly from **two blocks: a basic model**, developed to encode the language and its rules, **and a second model, which is fine-tuned to respond to specific instructions** (e.g. open questions/answers). This second model can then be further tailored to the desired task (e.g. customer relations chatbot) and/or aligned with stated values (e.g. adherence to a company’s ethical charter).\nThe pipeline of a generative LLM is as follows:\n\nThe biases in LLMs can therefore manifest both in the model itself (**intrinsic bias, which occurs in the model’s internal representations**) and in the final decisions it takes (**extrinsic bias, which occurs in final decisions and predictions).**\n\n## How to evaluate bias in LLMs\n\nBias in LLMs can be evaluated intrinsically and extrinsically. **Intrinsic methods** include analysing relationships between words in the model’s internal representations or observing differences in how the model assigns probabilities to words. **Extrinsic methods**, meanwhile, focus on how the model performs at specific tasks. There are **evaluation metrics** specific to traditional NLP tasks that aim to measure the quality of LLMs on reference data sets or generated text. In addition, **benchmarks** (comprising a test data set and NLP task-specific evaluation metrics) can be used to measure the quality and effectiveness of models on specific tasks such as machine translation, text generation etc. However, the test data sets used in the benchmarks can bring their own biases. The suitability of the benchmarks used is therefore a key issue when evaluating LLMs.\n\n## Mitigating bias\n\nBias in LLMs can be mitigated with or without additional training.\n  * **Additional training** may entail supervised or semi-supervised **fine-tuning** or methods to **align the models with expected values** (via reinforcement learning from human feedback or self-diagnostics). These methods make it possible to adjust models to reduce bias while maintaining their performance, but they are resource-intensive and can introduce new opinions, or new representations, and therefore new biases that are consubstantial with the new data added for these mitigation techniques.\n  * **In the absence of additional training**, techniques such as **post-generation self-diagnosis**[1] **or prompt engineering** can be used. These techniques, which do not require additional training, are simpler and require less expertise. They are therefore easier to implement. Post-generation self-diagnosis entails designing specific instructions to steer the model towards generating fairer and less biased responses. This is based on the model’s ability to evaluate its own outputs after generating them. **Carefully formulated prompts**, meanwhile, can force the model to adopt varied perspectives and avoid stereotypes. **Prompt engineering with roleplay**, where the respondent’s profile is specified (e.g. gender, education level), is also an effective method for revealing and mitigating certain biases. For example, by asking the model to answer a question as if it were an expert or a person from a specific social group, the bias implicit in the generated responses can be identified and corrected.\n\nVigilance and compromise are sometimes necessary to ensure that bias-mitigation actions do not harm the model’s performance.\n\n## Corporate action plan\n\nAll the above **must be combined with appropriate governance,** including establishing guidelines for managing bias, appointing ethics officers and managers responsible for training employees, and implementing active monitoring and development of technical tools. It is vital that the members of the teams involved in developing AISs are diverse.\n**Furthermore, several actions must be carried out** on a case-by-case basis, depending on the use case, the deployment context and the people involved**.**\n**First,** it is necessary to**choose the fairness criteria and**[**metrics**] and then to identify the NLP task underlying the use case and the known biases**. Then**,**different LLMs should be compared using an existing**[**benchmark**] or developing one ad hoc. Developing a benchmark requires collecting data, annotating it if necessary, defining the task and establishing how to measure that the task has been performed well on the body of data in question (evaluation metrics). **Then** it is a question of**selecting the least biased (and sufficiently powerful) model** by comparing the results of different models on the benchmark used. **The last step** uses prompt engineering to compare the results obtained on the benchmark with different prompts **in an attempt to optimise the prompt**, in accordance with the chosen fairness criteria. It should be noted that model performance may vary according to the parameters of the prompt (temperature[2], instruction[3], context[4], whether or not examples are provided[5] and system prompt[6]) and the role taken in the prompt. Testing and adjusting models according to specific use cases is therefore essential.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, managing LLM bias remains a **complex and evolving subject**. Although there are ways to evaluate (intrinsic and extrinsic methods, existing or new benchmark) and mitigate bias (with or without additional training), the area is not yet fully mature. **Within companies,** the focus is currently on **organisation,** **developing prototypes and experimenting**. Developing fair and accountable LLMs will undoubtedly help with their large-scale adoption.\n[1] This technique is based on the model’s ability to evaluate its own outputs after generating them. The model uses predefined criteria to evaluate the quality and fairness of the generated output (e.g. give me the answer and tell me if it is biased). These criteria may include measures of bias, stereotyping or toxicity. If the initial output is deemed to be biased or inappropriate, the model can either adjust the output in real time or generate a new response that takes the evaluation criteria into account. The revised output is then validated to ensure that it meets the fairness and quality criteria before being presented to the user.\n[2] Adjusting the temperature of the model allows you to control the creativity and diversity of the responses generated. Temperature is a hyperparameter that controls the probability of selecting subsequent words in a sequence. A low temperature (close to 0) makes the model more deterministic, while a high temperature (close to 1) increases the diversity of responses.\n[3] Instructions provide clear guidance on the task to be performed. They should be written concisely and accurately to minimise ambiguity and guide the model towards a specific response.\n[4] Context can be added to the prompt to provide general information that makes the instruction easier to understand. The context should be positioned at the beginning of the prompt in order to place the model in a specific framework and guide its responses.\n[5] Providing one or more examples of the expected prediction can help the model understand the task. The example must be representative of the task and be positioned at the end of the prompt to maximise its impact.\n[6] This involves adding guidelines to limit model responses to a specific format, thereby reducing noise and irrelevant responses.\n## Read more :\n\n### Lexicon\nLexicon\nLexicon\n**NLP (Natural Language Processing)**\nAn area of artificial intelligence that focuses on how machines understand and manipulate human language.

However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities present in society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data in many high-stake applications, it is important to explore the following questions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making classifications for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM classifications for tabular data influenced by social biases and stereotypes; and what are the consequential implications for fairness?Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular classification tasks. Furthermore, our investigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context learning and finetuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation emphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pretraining corpus, not only from the downstream task datasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent bias within LLMs.\nAnthology ID:\n    2024.naacl-long.198\nVolume:\n    Proceedings of the 2024 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (Volume 1: Long Papers)\nMonth:\n    June\nYear:\n    2024\nAddress:\n    Mexico City, Mexico\nEditors:\n    Kevin Duh, Helena Gomez, Steven Bethard\nVenue:\n    NAACL\nSIG:\nPublisher:\n    Association for Computational Linguistics\nNote:\nPages:\n    3603–3620\nLanguage:\nDOI:\n    10.18653/v1/2024.naacl-long.198 To the current version of the paper by DOI\nBibkey:\n    liu-etal-2024-confronting\nCite (ACL):\n    Yanchen Liu, Srishti Gautam, Jiaqi Ma, and Himabindu Lakkaraju. 2024.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, unify the literature with three intuitive taxonomies, and identify open problems and challenges for future work.\n## **Introduction**\nRapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the understanding and generation of human-like text, with increasing integration into systems that touch our social sphere. Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies: two for bias evaluation, namely metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation organizes metrics by the different levels at which they operate in a model: embeddings, probabilities, and generated text. Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation categorizes datasets by their structure; we also release a consolidation of publicly available datasets for improved access. Our third taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their intervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing. Finally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work. Synthesizing a wide range of recent research, we aim to provide a clear guide of the existing literature that empowers researchers and practitioners to better understand and prevent bias propagation in LLMs.\n## **Key Insights**\n### The Challenge of Bias in Large Language Models\nThe rise and rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has fundamentally changed language technologies. With the ability to generate human-like text and adapt to a wide array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the impressive capabilities of these models have initiated a paradigm shift in the development of language models. Instead of training task-specific models on relatively small task-specific datasets, researchers and practitioners can use LLMs as foundation models that can be fine-tuned for particular functions. Even without fine-tuning, foundation models increasingly enable few- or zero-shot capabilities for various scenarios like classification, question-answering, logical reasoning, fact retrieval, information extraction, and more.\nLaying behind these successes, however, is the potential to perpetuate harm. Typically trained on an enormous scale of uncurated Internet-based data, LLMs inherit stereotypes, misrepresentations, derogatory and exclusionary language, and other denigrating behaviors that disproportionately affect already vulnerable and marginalized communities. These harms are “social bias,” a subjective and normative term we broadly use to refer to disparate treatment or outcomes between social groups arising from historical and structural power asymmetries. Though LLMs often reflect existing biases, they can amplify these biases, too; in either case, the automated reproduction of injustice can reinforce systems of inequity.\n### Defining Bias and Fairness for NLP\nDespite the growing emphasis on addressing these issues, bias and fairness research in LLMs often fails to precisely describe the harms of model behaviors: _who_ is harmed, _why_ the behavior is harmful, and _how_ the harm reflects and reinforces social hierarchies. Consolidating literature from machine learning, NLP, and (socio)linguistics, we define several distinct facets of bias to disambiguate the types of social harms that may emerge from LLMs. We organize these harms in a taxonomy of social biases that researchers and practitioners can leverage to accurately describe bias evaluation and mitigation efforts. We shift fairness frameworks typically applied to machine learning classification problems towards NLP and introduce several fairness desiderata that begin to operationalize various fairness notions for LLMs.\n### Taxonomies for Bias Evaluation and Mitigation\nWith the growing recognition of the biases embedded in LLMs has emerged an abundance of works proposing techniques to measure or remove social bias, primarily organized by (1) metrics for bias evaluation, (2) datasets for bias evaluation, and (3) techniques for bias mitigation. We categorize, summarize, and discuss these three research areas.\n#### Metrics for Bias Evaluation\nWe characterize the relationship between evaluation metrics and datasets, which are often conflated in the literature, and we categorize and discuss a wide range of metrics that can evaluate bias at different fundamental levels in a model: (1) _embedding-based_ , which use hidden vector representations; (2) _probability-based_ , which use model-assigned token probabilities; and (3) _generated text-based_ , which use model-generated text continuations\nWe formalize metrics mathematically with a unified notation that improves comparison between metrics. We also identify the limitations of each class of metrics to capture downstream application biases, highlighting areas for future research.\n#### Datasets for Bias Evaluation\nWe categorize datasets by their data structure: (1) _counterfactual inputs_ , or pairs of sentences with perturbed social groups, and (2) _prompts_ or phrases to condition text generation. With this classification, we leverage our taxonomy of metrics to highlight the compatibility of datasets with new metrics beyond those originally posed. We increase comparability between dataset contents by identifying the types of harm and the social groups targeted by each dataset. We highlight consistency, reliability, and validity challenges in existing evaluation datasets as areas for improvement. Finally, we consolidate and share publicly available datasets here: https://github.com/i-gallegos/Fair-LLM-Benchmark\n#### Techniques for Bias Mitigation\nWe classify an extensive range of bias mitigation methods by their intervention stage: (1) _pre-processing_ , which modifies model inputs; (2) _in-training_ , which modifies model parameters via gradient-based updates; (3) _intra-processing_ , which modifies inference behavior without further training; and (4) _post-processing_ , which modifies model outputs. We construct granular subcategories at each mitigation stage to draw similarities and trends between classes of methods, with a mathematical formalization of several techniques with unified notation and representative examples of each class of method. We draw attention to ways that bias may persist at each mitigation stage.\n#### Open Problems and Challenges\nThe work we survey makes important progress in understanding and reducing bias, but several challenges remain largely open. We challenge future research to address power imbalances in LLM development, conceptualize fairness more robustly for NLP, improve bias evaluation principles and standards, expand mitigation efforts, and explore theoretical limits for fairness guarantees.\n## **Between the lines**\nAs LLMs are increasingly deployed and adapted in various applications, bias evaluation and mitigation efforts remain critical research areas to ensure social harms are not automated nor perpetuated by technical systems. However, the role of technical solutions must be contextualized in a broader understanding of historical, structural, and institutional power hierarchies. For instance, who holds power in developing and deploying LLM systems, who is excluded, and how does technical solutionism preserve, enable, and strengthen inequality? We hope our work improves understanding of technical efforts to measure and reduce the perpetuation of bias by LLMs while also challenging researchers to interrogate more deeply the social, cultural, historical, and political contexts that shape the underlying assumptions and values engrained in technical solutions.\nWant quick summaries of the latest research & reporting in AI ethics delivered to your inbox?

The impact of generative AI is predicted to be significant, offering efficiency and productivity enhancements across industries. However, as we enter a new phase in the technology's lifecycle, it's crucial to understand its limitations before fully integrating it into corporate tech stacks.\n\nLarge language model (LLM) generative AI, a powerful tool for content creation, holds transformative potential. But beneath its capabilities lies a critical concern: the potential biases ingrained within these AI systems. Addressing these biases is paramount to the responsible and equitable implementation of LLM-based technologies.\n\nRecognizing The Biases\n\nPrudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases. Here are several biases that can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems.\n\nMachine bias refers to the biases that are present in the training data used to build LLMs. Since these models learn from vast human-generated datasets, they tend to absorb the biases present in the text, perpetuating stereotypes and discriminations. Biases pertaining to race, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status can inadvertently be perpetuated by the AI system, leading to biased outputs.\n\nAvailability bias stems from the fact that LLM generative AI models are exposed to large amounts of publicly available data. As a result, the model is more likely to favor content that is more readily available while neglecting perspectives and information that are less prevalent online.\n\nThe availability bias in an LLM can create information bubbles and echo chambers that simply reinforce existing biases rather than fostering diverse perspectives. It can also lead to misinformation on a given topic if that misinformation is more readily available than factual content. This phenomenon can exacerbate social divisions and undermine the objective and balanced dissemination of knowledge.\n\nConfirmation bias is a psychological tendency in which individuals seek information that confirms their existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that challenges them. This can be demonstrated either in the training data or in the way that the prompt is written to which the generative AI will develop a response.\n\nWhen users seek information on a particular subject, the AI might selectively generate content that reinforces their viewpoints, leading to a reinforcement loop where users only encounter information that confirms their existing biases.\n\nSelection bias emerges when the training data is not representative of the entire population or target audience. If certain groups or perspectives are underrepresented or excluded from the training data, the AI model will lack the necessary knowledge to generate unbiased and comprehensive content.\n\nFor example, if the training data primarily comprises data from Western countries, the AI may struggle to produce accurate and culturally relevant content for non-Western audiences. This omission perpetuates societal inequalities and prevents the AI system from being an inclusive and unbiased information source.\n\nGroup attribution bias emerges when the generative AI attributes specific characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on the actions of a few individuals. For example, the AI might associate negative attributes with specific ethnicities or genders, perpetuating harmful generalizations and prejudices. To avoid this, LLM models must be trained on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups.\n\nContextual bias arises when the LLM model struggles to understand or interpret the context of a conversation or prompt accurately. Misunderstanding the context can lead to the generation of inappropriate or misleading responses. Data scientists need to fine-tune the model and carefully curate their prompts to better comprehend the context and avoid generating content that is contextually inappropriate or biased.\n\nLinguistic bias occurs when the LLM generative AI favors certain linguistic styles, vocabularies or cultural references over others. This can result in the AI generating content that is more relatable to certain language groups or cultures while alienating others. Data scientists should work to ensure that the AI model remains linguistically neutral and adapts to various language styles and cultural nuances.\n\nAnchoring bias occurs when an AI model relies too heavily on the initial information it receives. This could lead to the model incorporating early biases present in the training data and perpetuating them throughout its generated content. Data scientists must carefully curate the initial information provided to the model and continuously monitor its outputs to prevent this bias from taking hold.\n\nAutomation bias refers to the tendency of humans to blindly trust AI-generated outputs without critically evaluating them. This is one of the most concerning biases when discussing generative AI, as it causes individuals to place unwarranted trust in AI systems, assuming they are infallible.\n\nWhen relying on LLM generative AI for professional use, it is crucial for data scientists and users to exercise skepticism and independently verify the generated content to avoid propagating false or biased information. Blindly accepting AI-generated content without scrutiny can lead to the dissemination of false or biased information, further amplifying existing biases in society.\n\nMy doctoral study on big data governance provides some guidance for data scientists and technology leaders wanting to harness generative AI from LLMs. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing robust governance mechanisms for big data, which serves as the foundation for these LLM and generative AI models. By creating transparent guidelines for data collection, data scientists can actively identify and minimize biases in the training data.\n\nConclusion\n\nLLM generative AI offers transformative potential across industries, yet biases pose significant risks. Adhering to ethical AI development principles is paramount. Biases built into the models can affect content generation, emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, robust governance and vigilant evaluation.\n\nTo address these biases, data scientists must curate inclusive and representative training datasets, implement robust governance mechanisms and continuously monitor and audit the AI-generated outputs. Responsible AI deployment safeguards against biases and unlocks AI's true potential in shaping a fair and unbiased technological future.\n\nAs we continue to harness the power of AI, it is essential to exercise caution, promote transparency and strive for fairness to unlock the true potential of these transformative technologies.", "similarity": 95}, {"title": "Fairness standards for large language models", "url": "https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/fairness-standards-for-large-language-models/", "txt": "Fairness standards for large language models\n\nProject Contents\n\nOverview\n\nKey Information\n\nParticipants\n\nOverview\n\nLate 2022 and early 2023 saw breakthroughs in the commercialisation of large language models (LLMs), advanced AI systems designed for natural language processing tasks like text generation, summarisation, and translation.

However, LLMs have been shown to exhibit harmful social biases that reflect the stereotypes and inequalities present in the society. To this end, as well as the widespread use of tabular data in many high-stake applications, it is imperative to explore the following questions: what sources of information do LLMs draw upon when making predictions for tabular tasks; whether and to what extent are LLM predictions for tabular tasks influenced by social biases and stereotypes; and what are the consequential implications for fairness? Through a series of experiments, we delve into these questions and show that LLMs tend to inherit social biases from their training data which significantly impact their fairness in tabular prediction tasks. Furthermore, our investigations show that in the context of bias mitigation, though in-context learning and fine-tuning have a moderate effect, the fairness metric gap between different subgroups is still larger than that in traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest and shallow Neural Networks. This observation emphasizes that the social biases are inherent within the LLMs themselves and inherited from their pre-training corpus, not only from the downstream task datasets. Besides, we demonstrate that label-flipping of in-context examples can significantly reduce biases, further highlighting the presence of inherent bias within LLMs.\nPrimary Area: societal considerations including fairness, safety, privacy\nCode Of Ethics: I acknowledge that I and all co-authors of this work have read and commit to adhering to the ICLR Code of Ethics.\nSubmission Guidelines: I certify that this submission complies with the submission instructions as described on.\nAnonymous Url: I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors' identity.\nNo Acknowledgement Section: I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.\nSubmission Number: 8922\nLoading", "similarity": 95}, {"title": "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey", "url": "https://github.com/i-gallegos/Fair-LLM-Benchmark", "txt": "Bias and Fairness in Large Language Models: A Survey\n> Isabel O.

Wang and Redelmeier’s study reveals that LLMs are prone to biases, raising important questions about their role in medical decision-making. To prevent errors in decision-making with LLMs, it is recommended that clinicians aim to critically engage with LLMs (e.g. refuting their hypotheses rather than looking for confirmation) researchers should focus on identifying and evaluating collaborative strategies between AI and human decision-making. Furthermore, research on context-specific implementation is important. We need to ensure that AI complements, rather than replicates, human cognitive processes.

These tools, which power applications like chatbots, translation services, and content generation, can transform industries. But they also pose significant challenges. Let’s explore how Bias manifests in LLMs and what fairness means.\nWhat is Bias and Fairness in LLMs?\nBias in AI refers to systematic errors or tendencies that a model might make regarding its predictions that unfairly favour one group and disadvantage another. In Machine Learning, this Bias usually comes through the data used to develop models, the design of algorithms, or the interpretations of the outputs. The biased dataset that reflects stereotypes may make the LLM reproduce the stereotype in its responses.\nFairness in AI is about having the system treat all users equally and avoiding the perpetuation of societal inequities. In other words, models need to be designed with respect for diversity and deliver good results regardless of the user's background.\nHow does Bias Arise in LLMs?\nLLMs, like GPT or any other tool, are trained on massive datasets drawn from the internet, books, and other digital repositories. Such datasets often contain historical, cultural, and societal biases. Below are some of the key areas in which bias creeps into LLMs:\nData Bias : The training data may overrepresent or underrepresent certain groups, thereby leading to skewed outputs. For instance, if a dataset consists of predominantly Western-centric texts, the model may end up generating responses that favour Western perspectives.\nRead More\nCOMMENTS(0)\nComment\nRich Text
